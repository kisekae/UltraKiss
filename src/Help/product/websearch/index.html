		<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
		<p>The UltraKiss Search facility is a tool designed to automatically scan for KiSS
			sets on your computer.&nbsp; The Search tool will create an index of files on
			your computer for automated load through the UltraKiss Portal.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
		</p>
		<P align="left">The search is&nbsp;a five step process.
		</P>
		<P align="left"><STRONG>Step 1</STRONG>. Given a file directory or other URL,
			obtain the HTML page. The Search tool will parse the page to identify&nbsp;all
			links to LHA or ZIP archive files.&nbsp; Links to all subordinate directories
			or pages are searched recursively.&nbsp;&nbsp;This process effectively scans
			the subordinate structure looking for files. When all links in the hierarchy
			have been processed begin Step 2.
		</P>
		<P align="left"><STRONG>Step 2</STRONG>. For each archive file identified through
			the&nbsp;search process, load the file in UltraKiss.&nbsp; If the file
			successfully loads this validates it as a KiSS archive. The UltraKiss load is a
			batch process. No user interaction is required or permitted.
		</P>
		<P align="left"><STRONG>Step 3</STRONG>. With the file loaded, a thumbnail image is
			produced from the initial UltraKiss screen image. The set can also be saved to
			local storage. Set statistics are accumulated. This information is captured for
			each set.
		</P>
		<P align="left"><STRONG>Step 4</STRONG>. When all sets are validated an HTML index
			page to the set&nbsp;names is constructed. This is a table of all validated
			sets, by name, with thumbnail images and links to the set archive file. The
			HTML index is written to the directory specified in the UltraKiss Search
			options and named according to the site URL or top level directory originally
			specified in Step 1.
		</P>
		<P align="left"><STRONG>Step 5</STRONG>. The new HTML index is now added to the
			consolidated index maintained for all scanned hosts. This consolidated index is
			named in the UltraKiss Search options and is typically called
			'index.html'.&nbsp; Each primary site URL or top level directory is one line
			item in the main search index that links to the site specific HTML&nbsp;index
			page built in Step 4. The consolidates index is accessible by the UltraKiss
			Portal with the File-Index menu command.</P>

		<P align="left">Web Search options can be set through the Tool-Options-Search
			facility.</P>
		<P align="left">With default options, for local directory scans, the indexed KiSS
			sets are referenced through absolute paths to the file location on your
			computer. For world wide web scans, the identified archives are automatically
			downloaded and saved on your computer and referenced through absolute paths to
			the downloaded file location.</P>
