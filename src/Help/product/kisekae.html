<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UltraKiss is a computer program that implements the Kisekae Set system, KiSS, a Japanese graphics system originally developed to facilitate costume changes on virtual dolls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What does UltraKiss do?</b></font></h2>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original KiSS model was designed to create computer assisted costume changes for dolls or animation characters.&nbsp;  Kisekae  sets are drawings of anime characters with many different costumes, packaged in a file for viewing the work.. KiSS is a presentation method that allows the artist to program certain actions as you interact with the anime doll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UltraKiss was developed to help artists build their KiSS sets. UltraKiss can be used to view KiSS dolls and help with the construction of KiSS sets. There is an integrated color editor tool to change the colors of images.&nbsp; An image editor tool lets you change the size, shape, or structure of your images.&nbsp; There is also an integrated audio and video player so that you can include different sounds or movies in your set. For packaging the work, UltraKiss has an LHA, ZIP, and JAR archive file manager that lets you convert between archive types and save your KiSS set in standard files or compressed archive files.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> UltraKiss has been designed to provide improved developer support so that it is easy to create new KiSS applications.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How does UltraKiss work?</b></font></h2>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UltraKiss reads and interprets KiSS data files.&nbsp; These files contain computer graphics images, color palettes and data control files.&nbsp; Objects, such as the doll figure, costumes, and other items are constructed from layered image components that usually show only parts of the complete image.&nbsp; Objects can be manipulated through user actions or through&nbsp; a simple event processing model that enables timed animations or other actions if objects are touched or dragged across the screen.&nbsp; Color variations, enabled through palette changes in UltraKiss, can also be used to produce more realistic results.&nbsp; UltraKiss supports multimedia sound, graphic animation and worldwide web access to KiSS sets through an integrated Internet browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Why is KiSS fun?</b></font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Image manipulation, in a traditional sense, has been a source of entertainment over the years.&nbsp; It has always been fun to enhance or alter our perception of what we see.&nbsp; Children explore many learning experiences while playing with paper dolls.&nbsp; Others can have hours of fun solving more challenging puzzles and playing interesting games of skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> UltraKiss can also be used to create new computer applications for general entertainment or other purposes. You can build interactive presentations with active content, access web information, and deploy fully capable computer systems that process and manipulate image information.&nbsp; UltraKiss fully supports the KiSS model and provides new features that extend the Kisekae Set system into domains beyond Japanese animation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Where does the name Kisekae come from?</b></font></h2>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kisekae is an implementation of the Japanese Kisekae Set System.&nbsp; Kisekae takes its name from the Japanese term <EM>kisekae ningyou</EM>, which refers to playing dress-up with dolls. </font>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<h2 align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Where do I find KiSS material?</b></font></h2>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Artists from around the world create KiSS data sets from popular comic book and cartoon characters.&nbsp; Most KiSS data sets are available on the world wide web.&nbsp; Kisekae is a system that can grow with you as your interests and skills change.</font></P>
