<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">The UltraKiss Object Properties subsystem is a hierarchical system that
supports the display of all object properties for any object used within the
UltraKiss program.&nbsp; This includes the data set configuration object, all
cel and
group objects, palette objects, audio and video objects, FKiSS events and action
objects, and the FKiSS variable objects.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Objects Properties subsystem can be invoked in different ways.&nbsp; The <a href="menu.html#ViewDataObjects">Active
Objects</a> command on the UltraKiss View program menu is the direct entry into this subsystem.&nbsp;
The <a href="menu.html#FileProperties">Properties</a> menu command available on
the File menu of most Kisekae tools will also display the characteristics for the
current object of interest.&nbsp; The contextual popup menu for any visible object on the screen
can be used to invoke the properties dialog for the chosen object.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Property screens generally have a consistent format and
structure.&nbsp; The screen usually has three sections.&nbsp; The top
section displays various fixed attributes and characteristics of the
object.&nbsp; The middle section identifies visual
characteristics of the object, provides controls to manipulate the object, or
shows other objects related to the object in a parent relationship.&nbsp; The
lower section provides either a free form textual description
of the object or shows various objects related to the object in a
child relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

or pressing the View Object button.</font></p>

Audio objects have a time duration in seconds, a time position, and a latency

the sound file.&nbsp; A media player is used to play the sound file.&nbsp; The

<h3><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial">Image <a name="Cel Object Properties">Cel Properties</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Image cel objects are graphic objects that are displayed on the screen.&nbsp; Cel
objects have a rectangular bounding area that defines their size and location on
the screen.&nbsp; Cels can have a location offset, thus the actual bounding box
that defines where the cel is drawn depends on both the cel location and its
offset.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Image cels can be transparent or opaque.&nbsp; A transparency value of 255
indicates that the cel is completely opaque.&nbsp; A value of 0 is fully
transparent.&nbsp; The transparency value is a specific transparency that is
applied to every pixel within the image.&nbsp; The transparency value is initially
set with the %t tag attribute read from the configuration file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Image cels, if visible, are drawn.&nbsp; Cel visibility is changed with FKiSS map
and unmap action commands.&nbsp; Ghosted cels are drawn if visible but cannot be
selected with the mouse.&nbsp; The ghost attribute is initially set with the %g tag attribute read from the configuration file, or through the FKiSS
ghost&nbsp; action command.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Truecolor cels do not have palettes.&nbsp; Every pixel in a truecolor image
is defined with its own 32 bit RGB color value.&nbsp; Truecolor cels are also
known as CherryKiss cels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Images are copied if the same cel is used in more than one object group in the
active configuration.&nbsp; The copy state attribute indicates that the image cel
object shares its base image with another object in the configuration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The flex attribute shows the initial cel sticky value read from the
configuration file.&nbsp; This attribute is used to establish the group object
fix value used to limit the group object movement.&nbsp; The group object flex
value is set to the maximum value of all cels in the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The frames attribute shows the number of individual image frames contained
within this cel.&nbsp; Animated cels, such as GIF images can contain multiple
frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure 6.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A image cel can be associated with many different object groups.&nbsp;
The object group drop down box lists all groups that reference this cel.&nbsp; If a
different group is selected the object property attributes will change to
show the image state as it appears within the new group.&nbsp; The View
Object button will invoke the object group properties dialog as shown in Figure
7 for
the selected group.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">If the Edit Palette button is pressed the Color Editor tool is
invoked to examine or change the image colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The context preview window show an image of the image as it
appears in the current object group.&nbsp; A portion of the image can be selected and
magnified if the left mouse button is held down and a rectangular selection box
is drawn in the preview window.&nbsp; Pressing the right mouse button will
restore the image to its normal size.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Image cels can have FKiSS events attached to them.&nbsp; The List
Events button will display the event list in the text window for all FKiSS
events defined for this cel.&nbsp; The event list is a hierarchical tree that
lists all events and defined actions for each event.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows an
event list display from which event and action objects can be selected.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><a name="Cel Group Properties">Cel Group
Properties</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Cel Group objects are a recent FKiSS 4 extension used to group image cels
into various classes.&nbsp; Cel groups are a way for the programmer to direct
FKiSS actions to a class of image cels, rather than an object group. Cel groups have a
rectangular bounding area that defines the total area for all cels within the
group.&nbsp; Cel groups have a location offset equal to the minimum location
offset for all image cels.&nbsp; The group bounding box defines where a cel
group object&nbsp; is drawn and depends on both the group location and its offset.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The cel group attributes show the number of cels contained within the group and
the number of FKiSS events associated with the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

group attribute is not used..&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

Figure 5).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The object group attributes show the number of cels contained within the group and
the number of FKiSS events associated with the group.&nbsp; The lock value
attribute indicates if the object group can be dragged with the mouse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The state attributes show the characteristics of the group.&nbsp; Visible
groups can be drawn.&nbsp; Constrained groups cannot be moved outside of the
panel area window.&nbsp; Group movement is always constrained during an FKiSS
move action unless the unconstrain movement parameter flag is set.&nbsp; Group
movement is never constrained during mouse dragging unless the Limit Moves
program option has been set.</font></p>
