KiSS data sets.  This document provides reference material for the various commands and options available within the
UltraKiss program.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The UltraKiss window frame has a title bar that shows the program name and other
attributes of the currently loaded KiSS data set.&nbsp; A standard menu is
used to select program functions and options.&nbsp; An optional toolbar
can be used to select commonly used functions from the program
menu.&nbsp; The main panel area of the window shows the Kisekae UltraKiss logo.&nbsp; An
optional status bar at the bottom of the window shows the program copyright
information and other useful information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">KiSS data sets are displayed in the main panel area of the UltraKiss window.&nbsp; Once a set is loaded the user interacts with the objects
on the screen using the mouse and keyboard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The window title bar shows the name of the data set configuration file and
the name of the KiSS data set file.&nbsp; In Figure 2, the KiSS set was loaded
from the file named <i>testset.lzh</i> and the configuration element was named <i>fk3.cnf</i>.
The UltraKiss program menu and tool bar reflect the context of the currently loaded KiSS set.&nbsp
UltraKiss has commands to facilitate manipulating KiSS data.&nbsp; For example, the tool bar
can be used to switch between different KiSS page sets or color sets.&nbsp; Page
set buttons are numbered on the tool bar and color set buttons show the
background color of the palette.&nbsp; This data
set is currently displaying page set 0 and color set 0.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The test set shows buttons and objects that exercise various system functions.&nbsp;
The KiSS data set author has defined event actions for many objects on the screen.&nbsp;
If the user clicks the mouse while over such an object programmed event actions will
occur.&nbsp; UltraKiss supports all program event options defined by the <a href="../reference/fkiss1.html">FKiSS
1</a>, <a href="../reference/fkiss2.html">FKiSS 2</a>, <a href="../reference/fkiss2.html">FKiSS 2.1</a>,
<a href="../reference/fkiss3.html">FKiSS 3</a>, <a href="../reference/fkiss4.html">FKiSS
4</a> and the new <a href="../reference/fkiss5.html">FKiSS 5</a> UltraKiss specifications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 3 shows one page of another typical KiSS data set.&nbsp; This set is a reproduction
of Sailor Moon from the Japanese animation series.&nbsp; Various doll clothes are
shown.&nbsp; The mouse, when placed over a costume article will change to a hand
cursor as a visual indicator that the object can be picked up and moved on the
screen.&nbsp; If the set visible area exceeds the current window size scroll
bars will appear as required.&nbsp; Dragging an object will automatically scroll
the window. Note that this data set is currently displaying page set 0 and no
color sets exist for this data set.</font></p>
