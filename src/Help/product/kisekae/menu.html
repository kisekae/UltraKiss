<h1><font color="#FF0000"> UltraKiss Menu Commands</font></h1>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to the Kisekae UltraKiss program documentation. The UltraKiss Menu provides a
standard drop down list of commands for all program functions.&nbsp;</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 align="left"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial"> File Menu</font></h2>
<font face="Arial">
The File menu has commands to load, save, and print KiSS data sets.  The File menu also contains commands to display current data set properties and terminate the program execution.</font><p><font face="Arial">UltraKiss
can load complete data sets or expansion sets that contain additional
objects necessary to extend or enhance an existing KiSS data set.&nbsp;
Expansion sets must be added into the UltraKiss program after the original data
set has been loaded.&nbsp; UltraKiss can reuse objects from the currently loaded
data set if the expansion set objects are not contained
within the expansion archive file.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileNew"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">New</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial">
The New command is used to create new KiSS data sets. New data
sets create a default configuration element with one new empty page set in the
configuration.&nbsp; Graphic elements such as images can be imported into this
page with the <a href="#EditImportCel">Edit-Import Image</a> edit command.&nbsp; The
set configuration
properties can be accessed and edited through the <a href="#FileProperties">File-Properties</a>
command or the <a href="#ViewDataObjects">View-Data Objects </a>command.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

<p>  <font face="Arial">KiSS sets are defined&nbsp; by a KiSS
configuration file, or CNF file. A KiSS configuration file is a text file that identifies image cels, color palettes, and
programmed events associated with a KiSS data set. KiSS configuration files may be opened from a file directory or a compressed archive file.  When a configuration is opened and initialized all objects defined by the configuration are
read into the
UltraKiss program from the parent file directory or archive file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The new data set configuration file can be saved to a named file directory
through the <a href="#FileSaveAs">File-Save As</a> command.&nbsp; If a configuration
is saved all imported palette elements, cel elements, and other
elements are written to the named file directory.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileOpen"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Open...</font></a></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The Open command is used to open a new KiSS data set configuration file or any other file recognized by the Kisekae
UltraKiss program.&nbsp;
The UltraKiss program can open KiSS archive files, KiSS configuration elements, KiSS palette elements, KiSS cels, standard text files, rich text files, image files, sound files, and movie files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial">
KiSS configuration elements are processed with the UltraKiss program.&nbsp; KiSS palette elements are automatically opened with the <a href="../coloreditor/index.html"> Color Editor</a> tool.  Text elements are opened with the <a href="../texteditor/index.html"> Text Editor</a> tool.&nbsp;
KiSS cels and image files are loaded into the <a href="../imageeditor/index.html"> Image Editor</a> tool.&nbsp;
Sound and movie files are played by the <a href="../mediaplayer/index.html"> Media Player</a>.</font></p>

<p>  <font face="Arial">  A KiSS configuration file is a text file that identifies image cels, color palettes, and
programmed events associated with a KiSS data set. KiSS configuration files may be opened from a file directory or a compressed archive file.  When a configuration is opened and initialized all objects defined by the configuration are
read into the
UltraKiss program from the parent file directory or archive file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 1 shows a file Open dialog.&nbsp; Your dialog
may appear slightly different depending on your system software platform. To
load a KiSS set you must select either an archive files of type LZH or ZIP, or a
KiSS configuration file with a CNF extension. If the selected file
is a compressed archive file then it will be opened and the archive will be searched for KiSS configuration elements.&nbsp;If the file is of any
other type then the appropriate editing tool for the file type will be invoked.&nbsp;
If the file is not recognized then the user is prompted to open the file as a text file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The example in Figure 1 selected the archive file TESTSET.LZH.&nbsp; When
opening archive files, if only one configuration element exists within the archive file then this element will be
automatically loaded.&nbsp;
If many configuration elements exist in an archive file then the
UltraKiss program will display a selection dialog listing as shown in Figure 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">When a configuration element is selected it will be opened and processed.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows an
UltraKiss configuration file load progress window.&nbsp; Data set files are loaded
as a background activity.&nbsp; The file load progress window tracks the load of the configuration objects and displays any appropriate error message.&nbsp;
This window may be minimized if desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">A loaded configuration is automatically initialized on load completion if no load errors
occurred.&nbsp; If the window was minimized then it must be restored and the Play
or OK button pressed to activate the new configuration.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial"> The example load shown in Figure 3
had two syntax errors.&nbsp; Errors can be fatal or non-fatal.&nbsp; Non-fatal errors can be corrected by pressing the Edit button to
edit the KiSS configuration file.&nbsp; These types of errors can also be ignored if the Play button is
pressed to initialize the new configuration.&nbsp;  Fatal errors are not recoverable and the configuration load must be cancelled.
&nbsp;For related information see the <a href="../texteditor/menu.html">Text
Editor</a> documentation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial"> When a configuration is initialized any currently active configuration is closed.&nbsp;
Note that configuration file loading can be cancelled at any time by pressing the Cancel button.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileAdd"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Add..</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Add command is used to add expansion data sets to an open KiSS data set configuration file.&nbsp;
A Configuration Selection dialog as shown in Figure
2 is displayed.&nbsp; All configuration files found in the current data set
archive are listed in the selection dialog.&nbsp; After selecting a configuration the File Load activity
shown in Figure 3 begins.&nbsp; For
further information see the <a href="#FileOpen">File Open</a> command.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Expansion sets are loaded on top of the currently loaded 'base' set. Any
image cel or palette or audio object referenced in the expansion set but not
found within the expansion set archive is referenced from the 'base' set. Once
the expansion set is loaded the 'base' set is dropped. The new expansion set and
the objects referenced in the expansion configuration file now become the new
'base' set. If multiple expansion sets are loaded in sequence each builds upon
the last.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileSelect"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Select...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Select command is used to select and open a new KiSS data set configuration file
contained within the current file directory or compressed archive file.&nbsp;
A Configuration Selection dialog as shown in Figure
2 is displayed.&nbsp; All configuration files found in the current data set
archive are listed in the selection dialog.&nbsp; After selecting a configuration the File Load activity
shown in Figure 3 begins.&nbsp; For

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileClose"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Close</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Close command is used to close the currently active KiSS configuration file.&nbsp;
This will release all system resources associated with this data set.&nbsp; When the
configuration is closed UltraKiss will display the initial program logo screen
as shown in Figure 1 of the
UltraKiss Introduction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If any file in the currently active configuration has been updated or
modified the user will be prompted to save the current data set.&nbsp; Figure 5 is a close prompt that is shown on any attempt to close or exit the
program after a configuration set has been modified.&nbsp; If the program is not
being terminated, cancelling the save will cancel the
close request.&nbsp; If the current data set is saved&nbsp; the <a href="#FileSaveAs">Save As</a> command
is invoked.&nbsp; If not, the close operation will continue and all changes are
lost.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The View Changes button can be used to identify the file elements that have
been changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileSave"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">KiSS data sets are, by default, saved to the file directory or compressed archive file
from which they were loaded.&nbsp; For example, if the data set was loaded from
an archive file then all updated elements are written to this archive
file.&nbsp; If the files were loaded from a file
directory then the Save operation writes all updated elements into this
directory.&nbsp; Note that data sets loaded from
a compressed archive file may rewrite the complete archive file replacing all updated elements with their new contents.&nbsp;
For data sets
loaded from a directory only the updated element files are written.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Updated files are always written by referencing their contents as
found in memory.&nbsp; When saving to an archive, unchanged files can be written from their internal
memory copies or from their original source data.&nbsp; This behaviour depends on the setting of the
program <a href="options.html#SaveFromSource">Save from Source</a> option.&nbsp;
If this option is set unchanged or unloaded files are copies of&nbsp; their
source files. If this option is not set files written from their memory copies
reflect their current state and their final state is not
guaranteed to be identical to their source file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The currently loaded KiSS configuration file, if
updated, must be written from its
current state as retained in memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under normal conditions
the new file will
reflect all changes made to the current configuration but will not change any initial
page set object position.&nbsp; To write new page set initial object position,
see the <a href="#FileWriteAs">Write As</a> command and the <a href="#EditWritePage">Write
Page</a> command.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save operation is performed as a background activity.&nbsp; Figure
6 shows the file save window that
tracks the progress of the file output.&nbsp; The save operation may be
cancelled at any time.&nbsp; If an error occurs an appropriate
message will be displayed and the save operation will be terminated.&nbsp; If the
save is successful the file save window will be automatically closed.</font></p>

<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 6. File Save Window</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that files are written to temporary files on disk and then renamed to the permanent
file name if the save operation is successful.&nbsp; This ensures that a backup
file copy will exist in the event of a program error.&nbsp; The backup file is
normally deleted. Backups can be retained if the <a href="options.html#KeepFileBackup"> Keep File Backup</a> program option has been set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileSaveAs"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save As...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save As operation provides a means to save
the currently loaded KiSS data set to a new file.&nbsp; If the configuration was
loaded from a compressed archive file then the Save As function will save the
complete data set&nbsp; to a new compressed archive file name.&nbsp; If the configuration was loaded from a file
directory then the Save As function will save the new configuration element to a
new element name in a new directory.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 7 shows a standard file Save
As dialog.  The file Save As dialog will only accept file names consistent with the context of the currently loaded configuration.&nbsp; If the configuration was loaded from a compressed archive file then only archive file extensions can be specified.&nbsp; If the configuration was loaded from a file directory then
new configuration element names must be specified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save operation proceeds as described in the <a href="#FileSave">Save</a>
command.</font></p>

<h3><a name="FileSaveAsFiles"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save
As Files...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save As Files operation provides a means to
extract all KiSS configuration elements from a currently loaded archive file
and save the elements in the specified file directory. This operation is only
available if the KiSS set was loaded from an archive. An Archive Manager extract
dialog as shown in Figure 8 below can be used to navigate to and create the
destination file directory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that only files from the currently active
configuration are saved. Images and audio files not referenced in the current
configuration are not extracted from the archive.</font></p>

UltraKiss Edit features provide for full undo and redo recovery of all editing operations applied to the current KiSS data set.  Standard Edit functions to Cut, Copy, and Paste selected objects within and between page sets
are available.  Data set pages can be created or deleted and the current state of any page can be captured for output.  New images can be imported into the current page and edited if required.&nbsp;
For a full description of the features and capabilities of the Edit subsystem,
refer to the <a href="editing.html">Edit Functions</a> document.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Many edit commands operate with a selected set of objects.&nbsp; Objects are
selected through the <a href="#EditSelectAll">Select All</a> command or
graphically with a mouse selection operation.&nbsp; A mouse selection operation
is performed by positioning the mouse over an object and pressing the left mouse
button with the Alt key down, or by drawing a rectangular selection area with
the mouse while holding the Alt key down.&nbsp; All group objects visible within the selection box are selected even if they are
overlaid by another object.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Selected objects are visually identifiable.&nbsp; Each selected group shows a
rectangular marquee bounding box.&nbsp; UltraKiss is in edit mode if any object
has been selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">While in edit mode selected objects can be moved by positioning the mouse
pointer over the object and pressing the left mouse button and dragging the
object.&nbsp; This object moves regardless of its fix value as defined in
the data set configuration.&nbsp; The complete selection set can be moved as a
unit by holding the Shift key down and dragging any selected object in the group
or by double clicking the left
mouse button before dragging.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If a selection set exists new objects can be added to the selection set by
positioning the mouse over a new object and pressing the left mouse button while
holding the Ctrl key down.&nbsp; Alternatively, a new selection area can be
drawn while holding the Ctrl key down and all selected objects in this area will be added to the selection set

standard file directories.&nbsp; If an archive file is opened a selection dialog
will be displayed for all image files contained within the archive.&nbsp; Images
that are of KiSS Cel type require an associated palette file.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
a cel image is selected a palette selection dialog will be displayed.&nbsp; This
dialog will show all KiSS palette files found within the current archive file
or file directory.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Images can be imported to a new
object or to into the set of currently selected images. Importing images into a
new object always creates a new object number in the configuration. Importing
images into the current selection adds the image to the currently selected
object.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The image is loaded into the
upper left corner of the current page&nbsp; A new group object is
automatically created for this cel if the image was imported to a new object, and the new cel is inserted at the beginning
of the configuration cel list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the new cel object will be
displayed on top of all other cels in the data set.&nbsp; The current
configuration file may have to be edited to adjust the position of this cel to
obtain the desired overlay order.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Import Image operation can be undone.&nbsp; The Undo/Redo
operation is simulated through the use of the Cut/Paste facility.&nbsp; The Undo
command will remove the imported image from the current page through use of the
Cut operation.&nbsp; The Redo command will insert the deleted image into the

select the new file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Palette files are added to the [Palette] section
of the configuration file if and only if they do not previously exist in the
configuration. Audio files, after being added to the configuration, can be
referenced and saved with the configuration if the file is referenced in an
FKiSS sound() or music() or mediaplayer() action command. Video files, when

overlay order of the image cels. Cels are layered in sequence, such that the
earlier cels listed in the cel list are drawn on top of lower level cels.&nbsp;
New images imported into the set are placed first in the list.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A layering dialog window as shown in figure 19 below can
be used to visually drag images to different levels in the set. The preview
window shows the new layering order as adjustments are made. A cel can be
selected in the list and then dragged to another location and dropped. The list
will scroll if the mouse is dragged to any of the four corners of the list.</font></p>
