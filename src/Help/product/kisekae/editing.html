<h1><font color="#FF0000"> UltraKiss Edit Subsystem</font></h1>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Kisekae UltraKiss is a full featured development environment for creating, editing and displaying
KiSS data sets.  This document provides reference material for the various
editing commands and functions available within the
UltraKiss program.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Editing of a KiSS data set requires the ability to select various objects,
move them to new locations, cut, copy, and paste objects as required, and undo
changes that are not correct.&nbsp; UltraKiss is designed to facilitate easy
visual editing of a KiSS data set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a name="Edit Mode"><font face="Arial">Edit Mode</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">UltraKiss is in edit mode if any object on the current page is
selected.&nbsp; Selected objects are visually identified with a marquee
box around the object.&nbsp; This box describes the bounding box area of the screen
that is redrawn whenever the object needs to be repainted.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/menu_12.jpg" width="497" height="428"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Object Selection"><font face="Arial">Object Selection</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Objects are selected by Alt-left clicking with the mouse while over an
object, or by holding the Alt key and left mouse button down and dragging the
mouse to draw a selection box.&nbsp; Any object whose bounding box area is fully
contained within the selection box will be selected.&nbsp; Note that the
selection box will only be drawn for drag movement gestures that are to the left
and down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">All visible, but possibly hidden objects within the dragged selection box
will be added to the selection set.&nbsp; If objects are selected in this way
you will pick up not only the top, visible object, but also all hidden objects
that may be underneath the visible object.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Objects are unselected by Alt-right clicking with the mouse while over a
selected object, or by holding the Alt key and right mouse button down and
drawing a new selection box that encapsulates a set of currently selected
objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any object whose bounding box area is fully contained
within the selection box will be removed from the selection set.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Alt-right clicking will only remove top level visible
objects.&nbsp; If you need to remove hidden objects from the selection set, use Alt-right drag to encapsulate the underlying object in a removal selection box.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When no objects remain in the selection set UltraKiss is no longer in edit
mode.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A new selection set can be created by Alt-left clicking with the mouse while
over a new object, or by holding the Alt key and left mouse button down and
dragging the mouse to draw a new selection box.&nbsp; If a new selection set is
created all objects from the old selection set are discarded.&nbsp; It is possible
to select no objects, in which case UltraKiss will no longer be in edit mode.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Objects can be added to the current selection set by Ctrl-left clicking with
the mouse while over an object, or by holding the Ctrl key and left mouse button
down and dragging the mouse to draw a selection box.&nbsp; Any object whose
bounding box area is fully contained within the selection box will be added to the current selection set.&nbsp; Note that the selection box will
only be drawn for drag movement gestures that are to the left and
down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Selection operations are undoable.&nbsp; If you select the wrong objects or
wish to cancel the selection, the Edit-Undo operation will restore the selection
set to its prior state.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Object Movement"><font face="Arial">Object Movement</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">When in edit mode selected objects can be moved.&nbsp; These
objects are not restricted by their existing movement lock values.&nbsp;
Selected objects, when moved, do not fire FKiSS programmed events.&nbsp; These
objects do not participate within the normal play mode of UltraKiss.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To reposition a selected object on the screen, place the mouse pointer over
the object and left click and drag.&nbsp;&nbsp; To reposition all selected
objects in the selection set, hold the Shift key down, place the mouse pointer
over any object in the selection set and left click and drag.&nbsp; Shift-drags
will move the complete selection set.&nbsp; Alternatively, rather than use the
Shift key, you can double-click and drag.&nbsp; Once again, the complete
selection set will move.&nbsp; Double clicking is not as accurate as
shift-drags.&nbsp; The object beneath the mouse pointer can move slightly on the
first click before the complete selection set begins to move.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Move operations are undoable.&nbsp; If you move the objects to the wrong
place or
wish to cancel the movement, the Edit-Undo operation will restore the objects to
their prior positions.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Object Removal"><font face="Arial">Object Removal</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Selected objects can be cut from the data set and removed from the active
page on display.&nbsp; To remove objects use the Edit-Cut command.&nbsp; This
will copy the selected objects to the internal clipboard and then remove
them.&nbsp; The cut objects, because they are retained in the clipboard, can be
immediately pasted or re-inserted into a different page set if required.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If an object group is cut its reference is removed only from the active page
set on display.&nbsp; The object group can still reside on different page
sets.&nbsp; To remove the object from all pages you must explicitly cut the
object from each page.&nbsp; If an object no longer exists on any page it will
be removed from the list of object groups associated with the configuration and
eliminated from the data set when the configuration file is saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Image cels within a cut object group retain their original page set
association throughout the UltraKiss session.&nbsp; This association can be
re-established in the event the cut operation is undone and the group object is
restored.&nbsp; The image cel page set association will be permanently updated
only when the configuration file is saved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cut operations are undoable.&nbsp; If you cut objects and wish to restore
their presence, the Edit-Undo operation will paste the cut objects into their prior
positions.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Object Insertion"><font face="Arial">Object Insertion</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Objects within the internal clipboard can be pasted into the data set and
added to the active page on display.&nbsp; To paste objects use the Edit-Paste
command.&nbsp; This will take the selected objects from the internal clipboard
and add them to the current page.&nbsp; The pasted objects, because they are
retained in the clipboard, can be immediately pasted or re-inserted into the
same page or a different page set if required.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If an object group is pasted its reference is added to the active page set on
display.&nbsp; If the object did not previously exist on the page all image cels
contained within the object group simply have their page set associations
updated to include the new page number.&nbsp; If the object previously existed
on the page then a new object number will be created.&nbsp; This new object will
appear in the configuration object list and will contain new image cel entities
that are copies of the existing image cels.&nbsp; The new image cel entities
will also appear in the configuration image list and will be written to the
configuration file when the file is saved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Group objects pasted into a page retain their object position as exists on
their source page.&nbsp; If an object is selected and copied to the clipboard
and pasted, then the duplicate object will overlay its original position.&nbsp;
If this object is moved the original object will be seen.&nbsp; Pasted image
cels have the same depth layer as their original copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">New objects can also be inserted into the data set with the Edit-Image Import
command.&nbsp; This creates a new object for the imported image cel as described
above.&nbsp; Imported images are positioned at the upper left corner of the
image screen and must be moved to their desired position.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Paste operations are undoable.&nbsp; If you paste objects and
wish to undo their presence, the Edit-Undo operation will cut the pasted objects
from their new positions.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Object Duplication"><font face="Arial">Object Duplication</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Objects can be duplicated by first selecting the required objects, using the
Edit-Copy command to copy the selection set to the internal clipboard, and then
using the Edit-Paste command to insert the objects to the current page
set.&nbsp; Duplicated objects are created as described with <a href="#Object Insertion"> Object
Insertion</a>.&nbsp; If an object is duplicated on the current page then new object
groups are created, otherwise the image cels are simply updated to reference the
new page set.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If an object already exists on one page set and you wish to replicate this
object on other page sets, simply copy the object to the clipboard, switch to
the destination page set, and paste the object into the page.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Object Layering"><font face="Arial">Object Layering</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">When inserting new objects or adjusting your page sets, you may find that the
drawing overlay order for your image cels is unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The
Edit-Adjust Layering command can be used to alter the drawing priority for
all image cels in the data set.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Image cels are layered according to their position within the configuration
file.&nbsp; An image cel will be drawn on top of all image cels that
follow.&nbsp; The Edit-Adjust Layering command lets you reposition image cels
within the complete cel list to alter the drawing order.&nbsp; Select an image
cel from the list and drag it to a new position.&nbsp; When all changes are
applied the images on the screen are redrawn.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Object Layering operation is undoable.&nbsp; If you adjust the image
layers and
wish to undo the changes, the Edit-Undo operation will restore the previous
layering order to the data set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="New Page Sets"><font face="Arial">New Page Set</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">You can create new, empty page sets with either the Edit-Insert Page command
or the Edit-Add Page command.&nbsp; The Edit-Insert Page command creates a new
page set with the same number as the current page on display.&nbsp; The current
page and all subsequent pages have their page number incremented.&nbsp; The
Edit-Add Page command appends a new page set at the end of the
configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">New page sets are initially empty.&nbsp; You must populate the page with
objects of your choice.&nbsp; If you wish to duplicate all objects from an
existing page, copy the objects from the source page and paste them into the new
page.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">New page operations are undoable.&nbsp; If you create new page sets and wish
to undo the creation, the Edit-Undo operation will delete the new empty page set
from the configuration.&nbsp; All page numbers will be readjusted as required.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Delete Page Sets"><font face="Arial">Delete Page Set</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Page sets, and all objects contained on the page, can be deleted from the
configuration.&nbsp; Use the Edit-Delete Page command.&nbsp; This will remove
the current page and all objects on the page.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Page number are readjusted as required.&nbsp; All pages after the deleted
page have their page numbers reduced.&nbsp; It is possible to delete all pages
from the data set.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Delete page operation is undoable.&nbsp; If you delete a page set and
wish to undo the deletion, the Edit-Undo operation will add the deleted page set
back into the configuration.&nbsp; All page numbers will be readjusted as
required.&nbsp; All objects that existed on the deleted page will be restored.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Write Page Set"><font face="Arial">Write Page Set</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">During normal editing operations you will move and position objects as
required.&nbsp; An Edit-Write Page command is used to set the initial object
positions so that the objects will be positioned at their current locations
whenever the page set is opened or the Edit-Reset command is used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Edit-Write Page command sets the default palette group for the page set
to the current palette group being used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A common error is to forget to set the initial page positions after a page
has been edited.&nbsp; UltraKiss maintains current page positions during your
session so that pages are restored correctly while playing with your data
set.&nbsp; However, if you edit your data set and save it without updating the
initial positions, a reload of the data set may give undesirable results.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Either the Edit-Write Page command or the File-Write As command should be
used to capture the initial state of pages in the data set after an editing
session.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Write Page operation is undoable.&nbsp; If you update the object initial
positions and wish to undo the update, the Edit-Undo operation will restore the
original initial object positions prior to the change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
