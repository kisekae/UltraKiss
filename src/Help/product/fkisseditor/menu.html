<h1><font color="#FF0000">FKiSS Editor Menu Commands</font></h1>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to the Kisekae UltraKiss program documentation. The FKiSS Editor Menu provides a
standard drop down list of commands for all program functions.&nbsp;</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 align="left"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial"> File Menu</font></h2>
<font face="Arial">
The File menu has commands to create, edit or delete event definitions, edit the
text of the current configuration file, and show the properties of any selected
event or action object.  The File menu also contains commands to print the current
event definitions and terminate the FKiSS Editor execution.</font><p><font face="Arial">The FKiSS Editor can
edit the text of any event and apply the changes to the current data set
configuration.&nbsp; The changes take effect immediately and do not require a
restart of the configuration.&nbsp; All changes to event definitions are
re-parsed to identify syntax errors before any event definition is changed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial"><a name="FileNewEvent"><font color="#800000">New Event</font></a><font color="#800000">...</font></font></h3>
<font face="Arial">
The New Event command creates one or more new event definitions within the
current KiSS configuration.&nbsp; The New Event command opens an empty <a href="../texteditor/index.html">Text
Editor</a> screen in which the new event code can be typed, as shown in Figure
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/edit_01.jpg" width="532" height="262"></font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="Figure 1. New Event"><font face="Arial">Figure 1. New Event</font></a></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">More than one new event declarations can be defined.&nbsp; All
events within the text file will be created when the text editor is
closed.&nbsp; Each event is a new event and is added to the current
configuration.&nbsp; It is valid to create multiple events such as press events
for the same KiSS object.&nbsp; Each event declaration is unique and
individually processed when the external event signal occurs.&nbsp; New event definitions
are undoable commands.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">When events are added to the configuration the command syntax is
checked for errors.&nbsp; If a syntax error exists a warning message as shown in
Figure 2 will be displayed.&nbsp; When the error is acknowledged a new text
editor session will be created to enable error correction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Edit Event command is used to open a new <a href="../texteditor/index.html">Text
Editor</a> window that contains the full event text for the selected
event.&nbsp; To select an event highlight an event name or an event action
command in the FKiSS Editor event list display.&nbsp; If an action command is
selected the editor is invoked for the parent event of the action command.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The event name can be changed, the event parameters can be changed, and
action commands can be added or removed from the event definition.&nbsp; When the text editor is closed
any updated event definitions are parsed for syntax errors.&nbsp; If no errors exist the original event is removed
from the configuration and replaced with the new event definition.&nbsp; Event
editing is an undoable command.</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">If syntax errors exist then a message as shown in Figure 2 will be displayed
and the text editor will be re-invoked to correct the error.</font></p>







<p><font face="Arial">New event definitions can be added through the Edit
Event command.&nbsp; The selected event will be replaced with the first event
definition and all other events in the edited file will be added to the
configuration as new, unique events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<h3><a name="FileDeleteEvent"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Delete Event</font></a></h3>







<p><font face="Arial">The Delete Event command will remove the selected event definition from the
current configuration.&nbsp; To select an event highlight an event name or an
event action command in the FKiSS Editor event list display.&nbsp; If an action
command is selected the editor is invoked for the parent event of the action
command.&nbsp;</font></p>

<font face="Arial">
The FKiSS Editor provides full undo and redo recovery of all FKiSS editing operations applied to the current KiSS data set.&nbsp;
It is possible to undo or redo event definition creation, replacement, or
deletion.&nbsp; In addition, debugging edit changes to variable values can also
be undone or redone.&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Arial">FKiSS Editor edit functions can only be undone within
the current editing session.&nbsp; Once the FKiSS Editor is closed the edit
history is not retained.&nbsp; The FKiSS Editor is designed to be re-entrant for
continuous breakpoint processing and code correction.&nbsp; Thus, the editor
should only be terminated when all edit history can be discarded.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditUndo"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Undo</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The FKiSS Editor supports full undo and redo edit recovery for event editing
operations and variable value changes.&nbsp; These types of editing changes are reversible.&nbsp;
The Undo command will reverse the last edit change that was made to the current
KiSS configuration file.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditRedo"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Redo</font></a></h3>

<h2><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Run Menu</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Run Menu provides a set of commands to control breakpoint processing and
debugging of FKiSS events.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can set dynamic breakpoints on any
FKiSS event or action statement, the code will automatically interrupt, and you
can visually step though your code and watch it run.&nbsp; The event handling
interrupts whenever it tries to process a command that is flagged to breakpoint.
When breakpointed the window title will start with &quot;Breakpoint&quot; and
the event display will open to the interrupted statement.&nbsp; If you are in
breakpoint mode and tracing an event, you can single step through the code (F3),
step into the code (F4), run to a selected statement (F5), or run to the end of
the current event (F6).&nbsp; The active breakpoint line is shown in blue.&nbsp;
Execution is interrupted 'before' any breakpoint statement is executed so
variable values show the before state. If you single step through the code the
statement is executed in its entirety and the current line will move to the next
line. If you want to look at the 'after' values for the variables once the
statement is executed, examine the FKiSS Editor variable list or hold your
cursor over the just executed line to see a tool tip pop-up.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunExecute">Execute Statement</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Execute Statement command single steps through the FKiSS code and
executes each action statement in sequence.&nbsp; This command fully executes
any contained subroutine or gosub() action call before stopping at the next
statement.&nbsp; If the current statement is a goto() action, the Execute
Statement command will stop at the first statement of the new label event.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the top level traced event is complete the FKiSS Editor will display the
message as seen in Figure 9.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/edit_09.jpg" width="269" height="116">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure 9.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunStepInto">Trace Into Call</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Trace Into Call will drill down into subroutine or gosub() action
commands and breakpoint at the first action statement of the contained
routine.&nbsp; This command is equivalent to an Execute Statement if the current
action statement is not a subroutine call.&nbsp; If you trace into any action
call that invokes an alarm event, an interim breakpoint is set on the alarm, the
current traced event runs to completion, and the FKiSS Editor will open as soon
as the specified breakpointed alarm is fired.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunToSelection">Run To Selection</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Run To Selection command will resume action command processing.&nbsp; The
process will stop when the currently selected line in the FKiSS Editor event
list is reached or if the event terminates.&nbsp; Statements can be selected in
the FKiSS Editor event list by clicking on a line or using the cursor control
keys to position the selection to an alternate location.&nbsp; This command is
frequently used to resume breakpointed tracing at a specific location without
stepping though intervening action statements.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunToReturn">Run to Call Return</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Run to Call Return command will resume action command processing.&nbsp;
The process will stop when the current traced event completes.&nbsp; If this
event was called from another event, continued tracing through an Execute
Statement command will return to the next executable statement in the calling
event.&nbsp; This command is typically used to stop tracing the current event,
yet continue to trace execution within the parent event.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunSetBreakpoint">Set Breakpoint</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Set Breakpoint command will place an execution breakpoint on the
currently selected event declaration or action command statement.&nbsp;
Statements can be selected in the FKiSS Editor event list by clicking on a line
or using the cursor control keys to position the selection to an alternate
location.&nbsp; Event breakpoints interrupt normal processing whenever the event
is executed.&nbsp; Action statement breakpoints interrupt normal processing
whenever the action statement is executed.&nbsp; Breakpoints can be set through
this command or by right clicking while the mouse is positioned over an event or
action statement.&nbsp; Breakpointed lines are shown in red.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunClearBreakpoint">Clear Breakpoint</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Clear Breakpoint command clears a breakpoint from the currently selected
event declaration or action command statement.&nbsp; Statements can be selected
in the FKiSS Editor event list by clicking on a line or using the cursor control
keys to position the selection to an alternate location.&nbsp; Breakpoints can
be cleared through this command or by right clicking while the mouse is
positioned over an event or action statement that has a breakpoint
defined.&nbsp; Breakpointed lines are shown in red.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunDisableBreakpoint">Disable Breakpoint</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The FKiSS Editor can pause execution at the next statement or event processed
if requested.&nbsp; The Disable Breakpoint command is used to exclude the
currently selected event from automatic pause breakpoint processing.&nbsp; In
certain cases you may not wish to pause execution on a specified event.&nbsp;
The Disable Breakpoint command is used to eliminate these selected events from
pause breakpoints.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Text for disabled events is shown in a light grey color.&nbsp; If the
currently selected statement is an action statement the Disable Breakpoint
command will disable pause breakpoints for the action parent event.&nbsp; If an
event is disabled all breakpoints for the event and event actions are
removed.&nbsp; Individual breakpoints can be restored on disabled action
statements through the Set Breakpoint command.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunEnableBreakpoint">Enable Breakpoint</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Enable Breakpoint command restores a disabled event to normal
state.&nbsp; Disabled events are excluded from automatic pause breakpoint
processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Text for disabled events is shown in a light grey color.&nbsp; If the
currently selected statement is an action statement the Enable Breakpoint
command will enable pause breakpoints on the action parent event.&nbsp; If an
event is enabled all current breakpoints for the event and event actions are
retained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunClearAllBreakpoints">Clear All Breakpoints</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Clear All Breakpoints command will remove all breakpoint settings from
all event and action statements.&nbsp; This command is enabled if at least one
breakpoint is set in the configuration.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunProgramPause">Program Pause</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">You may wish to pause execution at the next event processed without knowing
the event that is being invoked.&nbsp; Or, you may wish to debug the executed event code
based upon on a user action such as a mouse press.&nbsp; The Program Pause
command can be used to stop FKiSS execution at the next event or
action statement processed.&nbsp; When the pause breakpoint is recognized the
FKiSS Editor will be automatically invoked to trace the event code.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The FKiSS event handler state is monitored by the indicator light at the
right end of the editor toolbar.&nbsp; A green light means the configuration is
running and events are being processed. Red means the event handler is
suspended. Yellow means that the configuration is running but will interrupt or
break at the first action command it has to process.&nbsp; If the indicator is
green a Program Pause command will turn the indicator yellow.&nbsp; If the
indicator is red a Program Pause command will activate program execution and the
indicator will turn yellow.&nbsp; Note that if you set a pause breakpoint and
there is an event that is being repetitively processed in a timer
loop, the interrupt can happen almost immediately, the indicator will turn red,
and you will directly transition to breakpoint mode.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Pause breakpoints are one time occurrences.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the FKiSS Editor
is invoked on a pause breakpoint the pause state is cleared.&nbsp; The pause
breakpoint can also be cleared manually by pressing the yellow indicator
light.&nbsp; This will remove the pause request and the indicator will turn
green.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Execution is always resumed on a Program Pause and the
UltraKiss main screen will be brought to the foreground.&nbsp; The FKiSS Editor
screen may continue to show&nbsp; in the background, however it will not be the
active window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunProgramResume">Program Resume</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Program Resume command continues program execution from a breakpoint
state.&nbsp; When execution is resumed the event handler is activated and the
UltraKiss main screen will be brought to the foreground.&nbsp; The FKiSS Editor
screen may continue to show&nbsp; in the background, however it will not be the
active window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Program Resume command is the preferred way to return to your current
UltraKiss session without permanently closing the FKiSS Editor.&nbsp; New
breakpoints will be processed by the current FKiSS Editor.&nbsp; Thus, the undoable
edit change history will remain valid for your editing session.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the program is resumed it may immediately breakpoint again on a new
FKiSS action command or event.&nbsp; This could occur if a breakpoint was set on
another action statement or event declaration or if a pause breakpoint had been
set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><a name="RunProgramRestart">Program Restart</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Program Restart command is used to reload the KiSS configuration and
restart program execution.&nbsp; Program restarts are required to breakpoint on
initialize() of begin() events that execute during program start-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a breakpoint has been
set on an initialize() or begin() event a new FKiSS Editor session will be
automatically launched on the configuration activation to trace the event.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A program restart will always terminate the FKiSS Editor.&nbsp; All undoable edit
change history is lost on program restarts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
