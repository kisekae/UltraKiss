<h1><font color="#FF0000">FKiSS Editor Toolbar</font></h1>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">The FKiSS Editor Toolbar is a menu at the top of the screen that
displays icons for common functions.&nbsp; The toolbar icons and their
functions are shown below.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/toolbar_new.gif" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#FileNew">New</a> event.
The New Event command creates one or more new event definitions within the
current KiSS configuration.&nbsp; The New Event command opens an empty <a href="../texteditor/index.html">Text
Editor</a> screen in which the new event code can be typed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/toolbar_doc.gif" width="25" height="26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#FileNew">Edit</a> event.
The Edit Event command is used to open a new <a href="../texteditor/index.html">Text
Editor</a> window that contains the full event text for the selected
event.&nbsp; To select an event highlight an event name or an event action
command in the FKiSS Editor event list display.&nbsp; If an action command is
selected the editor is invoked for the parent event of the action command.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/toolbar_undo.gif" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#EditUndo">Undo</a>
edit. The FKiSS Editor supports full undo and redo edit recovery for event editing
operations and variable value changes.&nbsp; These types of editing changes are reversible.&nbsp;
The Undo command will reverse the last edit change that was made to the current
KiSS configuration file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/toolbar_redo.gif" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#EditRedo">Redo</a>
edit. The FKiSS Editor supports full undo and redo edit recovery for event editing
operations and variable value changes.&nbsp; These types of editing changes are reversible.&nbsp;
The Redo command will re-apply the last edit change that was made to the current
KiSS configuration file.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_03.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunProgramPause">Program Pause</a>. You may wish to pause execution at the next event processed without knowing
the event that is being invoked.&nbsp; Or, you may wish to debug the executed event code
based upon on a user action such as a mouse press.&nbsp; The Program Pause
command can be used to stop FKiSS execution at the next event or
action statement processed.&nbsp; When the pause breakpoint is recognized the
FKiSS Editor will be automatically invoked to trace the event code.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_04.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunProgramResume">Program Resume</a>. The Program Resume command continues program execution from a breakpoint
state.&nbsp; When execution is resumed the event handler is activated and the
UltraKiss main screen will be brought to the foreground.&nbsp; The FKiSS Editor
screen may continue to show&nbsp; in the background, however it will not be the
active window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_05.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunExecute">Execute Statement</a>. The Execute Statement command single steps through the FKiSS code and
executes each action statement in sequence.&nbsp; This command fully executes
any contained subroutine or gosub() action call before stopping at the next
statement.&nbsp; If the current statement is a goto() action, the Execute
Statement command will stop at the first statement of the new label event.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_06.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunStepInto">Step Into Statement</a>. The Step Into
Statement will drill down into subroutine or gosub() action
commands and breakpoint at the first action statement of the contained
routine.&nbsp; This command is equivalent to an Execute Statement if the current
action statement is not a subroutine call.&nbsp; If you trace into any action
call that invokes an alarm event, an interim breakpoint is set on the alarm, the
current traced event runs to completion, and the FKiSS Editor will open as soon
as the specified breakpointed alarm is fired.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_07.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunToSelection">Run to Selection</a>. The Run To Selection command will resume action command processing.&nbsp; The
process will stop when the currently selected line in the FKiSS Editor event
list is reached or if the event terminates.&nbsp; Statements can be selected in
the FKiSS Editor event list by clicking on a line or using the cursor control
keys to position the selection to an alternate location.&nbsp; This command is
frequently used to resume breakpointed tracing at a specific location without
stepping though intervening action statements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_08.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunToReturn">Run to Call Return</a>. The Run to Call Return command will resume action command processing.&nbsp;
The process will stop when the current traced event completes.&nbsp; If this
event was called from another event, continued tracing through an Execute
Statement command will return to the next executable statement in the calling
event.&nbsp; This command is typically used to stop tracing the current event,
yet continue to trace execution within the parent event.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_11.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunSetBreakpoint">Set Breakpoint</a>. The Set Breakpoint command will place an execution breakpoint on the
currently selected event declaration or action command statement.&nbsp;
Statements can be selected in the FKiSS Editor event list by clicking on a line
or using the cursor control keys to position the selection to an alternate
location.&nbsp; Event breakpoints interrupt normal processing whenever the event
is executed.&nbsp; Action statement breakpoints interrupt normal processing
whenever the action statement is executed.&nbsp; Breakpoints can be set through
this command or by right clicking while the mouse is positioned over an event or
action statement.&nbsp; Breakpointed lines are shown in red.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_12.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunClearBreakpoint">Clear Breakpoint</a>. The Clear Breakpoint command clears a breakpoint from the currently selected
event declaration or action command statement.&nbsp; Statements can be selected
in the FKiSS Editor event list by clicking on a line or using the cursor control
keys to position the selection to an alternate location.&nbsp; Breakpoints can
be cleared through this command or by right clicking while the mouse is
positioned over an event or action statement that has a breakpoint
defined.&nbsp; Breakpointed lines are shown in red.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_13.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunDisableBreakpoint">Disable Breakpoint</a>. The FKiSS Editor can pause execution at the next statement or event processed
if requested.&nbsp; The Disable Breakpoint command is used to exclude the
currently selected event from automatic pause breakpoint processing.&nbsp; In
certain cases you may not wish to pause execution on a specified event.&nbsp;
The Disable Breakpoint command is used to eliminate these selected events from
pause breakpoints.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_14.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunEnableBreakpoint">Enable Breakpoint</a>. The Enable Breakpoint command restores a disabled event to normal
state.&nbsp; Disabled events are excluded from automatic pause breakpoint
processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/toolbar_15.gif" width="25" height="25">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="menu.html#RunClearAllBreakpoints">Clear All Breakpoints</a>.
The Clear All Breakpoints command will remove all breakpoint settings from
all event and action statements.&nbsp; This command is enabled if at least one
breakpoint is set in the configuration.</font></p>
