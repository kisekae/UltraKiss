		<p><font face="Arial">Close any loaded set to ensure that UltraKiss displays the main logo
        screen.&nbsp; Use the File-New
			command to create a new data set.&nbsp; This will automatically create a new configuration
			file in the data set and the new configuration will be assigned a new
			sequential name.&nbsp; One new empty page set will be created for
			you.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">You must now import images into this page using the Edit-Import command.&nbsp;
			You can also edit the configuration file manually to construct your KiSS data
			set.&nbsp; You can use the UltraKiss edit functions to position images on the
			page, adjust their layering order, or otherwise develop your data set.&nbsp;
			For further information see the tutorial document that provides hints and
			advice on constructing data sets.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Remember to save your new data set.&nbsp; All new data set files will be written
			to the file directory selected for saving the configuration element.&nbsp; You
			may rename the configuration element when it is saved.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="How do I create a new, different configuration file for my data set?"><font face="Arial">How do
					I create a new, different configuration file for my data set?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">With your KiSS set loaded into UltraKiss,&nbsp; use the View-Active
			Configuration command to open a text editor window for your existing
        CNF file.&nbsp; Save the file under a different name to create a copy of
        your configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">If you save the file with a CNF extension the new file name will show up in the
			File-Select command configuration list.&nbsp; Select the new configuration and
			load it into UltraKiss.&nbsp; You can now use UltraKiss to import new images or
			edit the configuration as required.&nbsp; All edit changes will now be applied
			to the new configuration element.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="How do I load expansion sets into UltraKiss?"><font face="Arial">How do I load expansion sets
					into UltraKiss?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Load your original or base KiSS configuration file into UltraKiss with the
			File-Open command.&nbsp; Then, load your expansion set with the File-Add
			command.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Expansion sets are loaded on top of the currently loaded base set. Any image cel
			or palette or audio object referenced in the expansion set but not found within
			the expansion directory or archive is referenced from the base set. Once the
			expansion set is loaded the base set is dropped. The new expansion set and all
			objects referenced in the expansion configuration file become the new base set.
			If multiple expansion sets are loaded in sequence each builds upon the last. It
			would be problematic if the original base set contained a line item for
			'shirt.cel', the first expansion did not contain this line, and the second
			expansion did. The second expansion load would fail as 'shirt.cel' would have
			been dropped as a result of the first expansion set load.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Similarly, if multiple configuration files exist in an expansion set and each
			configuration file references different sets of objects from the base file,
			then any attempt to select a new expansion configuration after the load will
			fail. The base objects referenced in the second expansion configuration file
			will have been dropped when the first configuration file was opened.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">UltraKiss does not know that a set is an expansion set. If an expansion is
			loaded on the wrong base set many errors will occur. This is why the 'cancel'
			option exists. If the expansion load is cancelled the original base set should
			still be available.</font></p>

		<p><b><a name="How do I package my Kiss data set into an LZH file?"><font face="Arial">How do I package my
					KiSS data set into an LZH file?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">If your data set elements are all contained within a standard file directory you
        can use the Archive Manager tool create a new LZH file and then add all your
			KiSS data set elements from your directory into this file.&nbsp; If you have
			segregated your data set into subdirectories remember to set the 'recurse
			folders' and 'save relative path' options to add all the subordinate files,
			too.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">You can also load your set from its directory and
        use the File-Save As Archive command to save all set KiSS elements in a
        new archive file.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">If your data set is already packaged into an archive file, then you must open
			this archive file in the Archive Manager and copy it or save it to a new file
			name with the LZH extension.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="What is the difference between a grouped object and an ungrouped object?"><font face="Arial">What
					is the difference between a grouped object and an ungrouped object?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Grouped objects and ungrouped objects are terms applied to selection sets when
			using the UltraKiss editing features.&nbsp; In KiSS, the term 'object' is an
			abstract term that relates a number of entities to a particular point on the
			screen.&nbsp; In practice, an 'object group' is the realization of this
			abstraction and is a concrete implementation of a number of image cels in one
			movable group that is visible on the screen.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">When visually editing your data set you will sometimes work with the object
			groups and you will sometimes work with the individual image cels.&nbsp; If you
			are editing an object group, then this group is a collection of entities such
			as cels.&nbsp; The selected object group is called a 'grouped object'.&nbsp;
			This group must be broken up into its individual components if you want to work
			with the actual image cels.&nbsp; When the group is broken up it is called an
			'ungrouped object'.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The Edit-Ungroup Object command breaks all selected object groups apart.&nbsp;
			You will then have a number of individual image cels that can be separately
			positioned or cut or copied or pasted as required.&nbsp; These individual image
			cels can be regrouped back into their original object groups or combined into a
			new object group by using the appropriate edit command.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="What is the image offset and how is it used?"><font face="Arial">What is the image offset and
					how is it used?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The image offset is an attribute of every image in the KiSS data set.&nbsp; The
			image offset is a displacement from the image location.&nbsp; This offset is
			used to calculate the bounding box that describes the area of the screen that
			needs to be repainted when the image is drawn.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Image offsets are used to position image cels within object groups.&nbsp; Every
			object group has a location on the screen and each image cel within the group
			is initially located at this object group location.&nbsp; The image offset is
			used as the displacement from the object group location to identify where the
			image cel must be drawn within the object group.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Image offset values are stored as internal attributes of CEL files and GIF
			files.&nbsp; Offset values are not stored internally for JPG, BMP, or PPM
			files.&nbsp; Thus, if you save an updated data set and write the images to new
			files, the actual offset values in use will be written inside GIF and CEL image
			files, and written as UltraKiss %offset flags on the configuration object lines
			for all other image types.&nbsp; If you replace a GIF or CEL file outside of
			UltraKiss with an old copy of the image you can lose all positioning offset
			changes that UltraKiss has made for you through your previous editing
			operations.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="How does UltraKiss process FKiss events?"><font face="Arial">How does UltraKiss process FKiSS
					events?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial"> UltraKiss uses multiple event handler threads or activities to process
			events. There is one master event queue and each event handler scans this queue
			every N milliseconds looking for work. If an event has been queued, such as a
			press event or a keystroke event, then the event is captured, fired, and
			executed. During event execution the capturing event handler is busy. If
			another event is queued at this time then a different event handler thread can
			capture the new event and process it. Thus, on a multi-activity system we can
			have two or more event handlers running concurrently.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Each FKiSS event is a single block of action commands. Each action statement in
			the block is processed in sequence.&nbsp; Sequential statement flow can be
			altered through the use of 'gosub' actions or 'goto' actions, or loop control
			statements such as 'for' and 'while'.</font></p>
		<p>
            <font face="Arial">
			The 'gosub' and 'goto' actions refer to label events.&nbsp; A label event&nbsp;
			is an event that contains a new set of action commands.&nbsp; 'Gosub' and
			'goto' actions directly fire a label event without queuing it, thus the label
			event runs under the current event handler thread.&nbsp; A 'gosub' action
			recursively fires a label event so that it will return to the correct call
			point and a 'goto' action jumps to the beginning of the label event as no
			return is required.&nbsp;&nbsp; All actions within a label event are treated as
			a separate block.</font></p>
		<p>
            <font face="Arial">
			All loop control statements must be consistent within the same event
			block.&nbsp; A 'for' statement in one block cannot match with&nbsp; a 'next'
			statement in a different label block.&nbsp;&nbsp; An 'if-else-endif ' sequence
			must be fully contained within one label block.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="How does the UltraKiss timer action work?"><font face="Arial">How does the UltraKiss timer
					action work?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Timer actions set alarm event states. An alarm is an event that can contain a
			series of action statements.&nbsp; A separate activity monitors all alarms and
			will queue an alarm event when the alarm time period has expired.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p>
            <font face="Arial">
			With multiple event handlers, if a short timer period was set the alarm could
			fire immediately and the alarm event could run concurrently with the scheduling
			event. This behaviour seemed incompatible with coding practices that assumed
			timer actions were not immediate, as would occur with a single threaded viewer
			implementation. To maintain compatibility with other KiSS viewers UltraKiss
			disabled firing alarms referenced by the event timer actions until the primary
			scheduling event terminates.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="Timer action statements do not seem to be completely time accurate.  Why is this?"><font face="Arial">Timer
					action statements do not seem to be completely time accurate.&nbsp; Why is
					this?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The UltraKiss timer is a polled timing implementation.&nbsp; The alarm queue is
			polled on a periodic basis looking for alarms whose time has expired.&nbsp; For
			UltraKiss timing to be accurate a timer action command period must be an exact
			multiple of the timer period seen in the Options-FKiSS-Timer setting.&nbsp; If
			the timer action command programmed delay is not a multiple of the timer period
			then the timer must wait for the next cycle to fire.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The default timer period is 10 milliseconds.&nbsp; It is not constructive or
			possible to set a smaller value.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">For accurate timing ensure that all timer action statement values are exact
			multiples of the timer period.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="Why can I not move images within the Color Editor preview window?"><font face="Arial">Why can I
					not move images within the Color Editor preview window?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The image preview window does not let you to pick up and move images in the
			window. (The preview window is not an UltraKiss viewer). The move pointer
			simply lets you adjust the location of the image in the window but only if the
			image exceeds the window size. This would be the case if a portion of the
			preview image was magnified or zoomed.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="How do I change the color of an image or article of clothing?"><font face="Arial">How do I
					change the color of an image or article of clothing?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">You use the color editor to change image colors.&nbsp; The best way to change
			the color of an article of clothing is to first select a pixel in the preview
			image with the eyedropper, then select all 'similar' colors using the Hue
			button. The sensitivity of the Hue button is controlled with the little up-down
			arrows in the corner of the button. As you increase the sensitivity value more
			and more colors from the palette will be chosen.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Once you have the colors selected, switch to the HSB panel of the color chooser
			and drag the slider to a new hue. The preview image will change to show the new
			colors. Pixel hues are adjusted based upon their relative differences from the
			first, or active color that you selected with the eye dropper. Dark colors
			remain dark and light colors remain light.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">It is quite easy to change overall tint in this way. For example, try changing
			the color of an image from red to blue.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">If the results in the preview window are not what you want then simply undo the
			color change. If you missed selecting all the necessary colors, simply increase
			the sensitivity on the Hue selection button and try again, or pick up a
			different colored pixel from the preview image and use the Hue button to select
			a different set of 'similar' colors. Best results occur if you initially select
			a middle-of-the-road color for the active color.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="What happens when colors are changed in the Color Editor?  Some colors change in unexpected ways."><font face="Arial">What
					happens when colors are changed in the Color Editor?&nbsp; Some colors change
					in unexpected ways.</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">When new colors or tints are applied to the image relative adjustments are made
			to color hue, brightness and saturation. If you use the color chooser and
			significantly darken or lighten differences from the active color then some
			related colors in the selection set may become 'saturated', or reach their
			limit of change. If necessary, you can turn off relative brightness, saturation
			or hue changes by right clicking on the appropriate toolbar button to disable
			it.&nbsp; You can also turn off relative color adjustments through the Options
			menu.&nbsp; If this is done all selected colors will be set to the specific
			active color.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The color editor is designed to change hue. The identical techniques will work
			to change the brightness, saturation, red, green, or blue color components of
			the image.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><b><a name="When I edit the colors of a KiSS cel, colors change in other cels, too.  Why does this happen?"><font face="Arial">When
					I edit the colors of a KiSS cel, colors change in other cels, too.&nbsp; Why
					does this happen?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">More than one KiSS cel can use the same KCF palette files for colors.&nbsp; If
			you edit a KCF file then all cels that use this KCF will change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">There is an 'All Cels' option in the image cel drop-down box that can be used to
			concurrently draw all images in the preview window for an active KiSS data set.
			If a color change is made to one specific cel then this option is helpful to
			see the impact on all other cels that use the same KCF file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p>
            <font face="Arial">
			This option does not exist for external palette files loaded with the color
			editor File-Open command.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">If you are editing an active configuration and are satisfied with the color edit
			changes, then the changes can be applied to the active KiSS data set when you
			exit from the color editor. If the color changes are now seen to be
			unsatisfactory, you can easily undo the KiSS data set changes with the
			Edit-Undo function, and try again.</font></p>

					save a GIF (or BMP or JPG or PPM) file as a CEL file?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">GIF or BMP or JPG or PPM files can be loaded into either the color editor or the

		<p><font face="Arial">If your data set was loaded from a compressed archive file UltraKiss will write

		<p><b><a name="How are movies implemented in UltraKiss?"><font face="Arial">How are movies implemented in
					UltraKiss?</font></a></b></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Movies are image cels.&nbsp; They are very similar to GIF animated cels.&nbsp;
			You define a movie cel in the KiSS configuration file as you would any other
			image cel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Because movies are cels, they can be used in the same way as other image
			cels.&nbsp; They can be picked up, moved, mapped, unmapped, and so on.&nbsp;
			Movies differ from normal image cels in the following ways.</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
                <font face="Arial">
				Movie cels are not visible unless they are playing.&nbsp; Visible movies are
				always displayed on top of all image cels.&nbsp; It is not possible to overlay
				a movie with another image.&nbsp; You start and stop a movie with the FKiSS				movie() action command.&nbsp; This will make the movie visible.<br>
              </font>
		  <li>
                <font face="Arial">
				Movie cels cannot be made transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial">Movie cels do not begin playing when the cel is mapped, or made visible.&nbsp;
			However, this behaviour may be implemented in a future release.</font></p>

		<p><a name="How does object collision detection work in UltraKiss?"><b><font face="Arial">How does object
					collision detection work in UltraKiss?</font></b></a></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Objects collide when they touch.&nbsp; The FKiSS events		in(), out(),		stillin(), stillout(),		apart(), collide() and
			their related action commands all examine whether or not the objects touch.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Collision events can occur whenever objects are moved, either through dragging
			with the mouse or any related FKiSS move action command.&nbsp; Collision events
			are fired when the object stops moving.&nbsp; This happens on a mouse release
			if the object is being dragged, or upon completion of the move command if the
			object is being moved through an FKiSS action.&nbsp; The event is not fired
			during the move, so transitory inter-object collision events are not recognized
			if the object happens to pass over or through some other object.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">If a sticky object group is moved collision events are not detected.&nbsp;
			Sticky objects snap back to their original position.&nbsp;They are considered
			not moved.&nbsp; Any movement event that has a zero displacement from the
			object start position does not fire collision events.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Collision events happen when objects are moved with an FKiSS action command or
			manipulated with the mouse.&nbsp; Collision events can also occur when object
			visibility is changed, as could happen if a previously unmapped object was made
			visible over top of another object.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">UltraKiss uses an asynchronous event processing model and there is no defined
			collision event execution order.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The events in(), out(), stillin() and stillout() check whether their object
			group image bounding boxes touch or overlap.&nbsp; Object groups can contain
			many images.&nbsp; When two object groups overlap there must be at least one
			image from each object group whose image bounding boxes have a non-empty
			intersection.&nbsp; For object groups to touch their contained images need not
			be visible or mapped but they must contain image cels that are defined to be on
			the current page.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The apart() and collide() events check for overlaid images.&nbsp; These events
			examine image pixels looking for non-transparent pixels that overlap.&nbsp; A
			non-transparent pixel is any pixel that is not completely transparent.&nbsp;
			For image cels to touch they must be visible on the current page and their
			image bounding boxes must have a non-empty intersection.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The same image cel can exist in more than one object group.&nbsp; Thus, it is
			quite possible to specify an FKiSS event that specifies the same image name for
			each argument, such as collide("image.cel","image.cel").&nbsp; In this case the
			collision checks for image overlap between different copies of the image cel in
			different object groups.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Collision events are symmetric.&nbsp; An event such as in(#1,#2) is equivalent
			to in(#2,#1).&nbsp; A collision between object 1 and object 2 is the same as a
			collision between object 2 and object 1.&nbsp; UltraKiss ensures that the
			symmetric event is always recognized so it does not need to be coded.</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><a name="In what sequence are events processed?"><b><font face="Arial">In what sequence are FKiSS events
					processed?</font></b></a></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">UltraKiss uses a multi-activity asynchronous event processing model.&nbsp;
			Events are queued when recognized and can begin execution immediately&nbsp; on
			a multi-activity system if resources are available.&nbsp; There is no guarantee
			of a specific event execution order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">For user initiated actions the mouse down signal will occur first, followed by a
			series of mouse drag events, and then the mouse up signal.&nbsp; UltraKiss
			queues FKiSS press(),		catch(), and fixcatch() events
			on a mouse down signal.&nbsp; FKiSS drop(<a href="reference/fkiss4.html#drop">)</a>,
			fixdrop() and		unfix() events can be queued at any time on mouse drag actions if a
			sticky object snaps back to its starting location.&nbsp; The FKiSS collision
			events in(),		out(), stillin(),		stillout(<a href="reference/fkiss2.html#stillout">)</a>, apart(<a href="reference/fkiss2.html#apart">)</a> and		collide() are queued on a mouse up signal, followed by necessary
			drop(), fixdrop(), release() and
			unfix() events.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">When a KiSS data set is initialized UltraKiss processes, in sequential order,
			any initialize() events, any		version() events, then any begin()
			events.&nbsp; During initialize() and version() no action command related
			events are recognized or queued.&nbsp; For example, a changeset() command in
			initialize() will not initiate set() events for the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Event handler activities are started before the begin() event.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			During begin(), action command related events and alarms are recognized and
			queued for execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">When the begin() event terminates UltraKiss will open the last page set
			referenced through a changeset() command, or page set 0 if the starting page
			was not set.&nbsp; When a page set is opened or a changeset() action command is
			executed UltraKiss will process any set()
			events defined for the page.&nbsp; When a page set is opened an associated
			color set can automatically open, too.&nbsp; When a color set is opened or a
			changecol() action command is executed UltraKiss will process any		col() events defined for the palette group.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">On a multi-activity system the FKiSS programmer cannot assume that events will
			always execute sequentially in the order in which they are queued.&nbsp;
			Sequential execution is possible only if a single FKiSS event handler is
			configured.&nbsp; See Options-FKiSS-Event
				Handlers.</font></p>
