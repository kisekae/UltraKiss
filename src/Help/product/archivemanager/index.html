<h2><b><a name="Introduction"><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Archive Manager is a full featured data compression and extraction program designed to manipulate KiSS data
sets stored in LHA, ZIP, or JAR format archive files.  This online Help document provides reference material for
the various commands and options available within the Archive Manager program.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">Archive files are compressed files.&nbsp; The information in an archive file
is encoded using data compression algorithms that are designed to reduce the
amount of space required to store the data.&nbsp; To compress data you use the
Archive Manager to create a new compressed file and add data elements to this
file.&nbsp; To uncompress data you use the Archive Manager to read a compressed
file and extract the compressed data to a file directory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Archive files are like file directories.&nbsp; Each archive file contains
many file elements.&nbsp; Archive files are ideal for KiSS data sets because
these sets are composed of many different elements
including configuration files, palette files, image files and so on.&nbsp;Compressed
file archives are a simple and easy way to encapsulate a KiSS data set for packaging and
distribution to other users.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial">
However, archive files differ from file directories in that archive files must
be completely rewritten whenever any element of the archive is changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;UltraKiss
knows how to read archive files and will
automatically uncompress KiSS data sets in LZH, ZIP or JAR format when they are
loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; UltraKiss will also compress file elements and
add them to the KiSS archive file when they are saved, however for large archive
files this file updating can take time.&nbsp; It can be more effective to
uncompress a KiSS archive before using UltraKiss particularly if many edit changes are planned.&nbsp;
UltraKiss can read data sets from standard file directories.&nbsp; If a file is
referenced from a standard directory then only the changed element need be
written.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that compressing files is not always useful.&nbsp; Many
standard image formats are already compressed as part of their representation
and recompressing compressed files is not effective.</font></p>

<h2><a name="Archive Manager Main Screen"><font face="Arial">Archive Manager Main Screen</font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The main Archive Manager screen is shown in Figure 1.&nbsp; The Archive
Manager contains a standard menu bar of functions to manipulate an archive file and
a toolbar for easy access to common menu functions.&nbsp; The elements contained
within an open archive file are listed in the main area of the screen.&nbsp;
These elements have names, dates, uncompressed sizes, compression ratios,
compressed sizes, and internal directory path information useful for
reconstructing a directory hierarchy when the archive file is uncompressed.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Figure 2 shows the Archive Manager after a compressed file has
been opened with the <a href="menu.html#FileOpen">File-Open</a> command.&nbsp; The
status line at the bottom of the window provides overall compression information
for the file.&nbsp; The file TESTSET.LZH has been compressed to about 20% of its
original size.&nbsp; This is a significant savings in space for distribution of the file to other users.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Archive Manager supports archive files that contain both
absolute and relative path names.&nbsp; If file elements within the archive were
saved with path names then these elements can be restored to the appropriate
file directories on extraction.&nbsp; For further information see the <a href="add.html">Add
Functions</a> document and the <a href="extract.html">Extract Functions</a> document.</font></p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Archive Manager Add Screen"><font face="Arial">Archive Manager Add Screen</font></a></h2>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">To add new file elements to the archive file you use the <a href="menu.html#EditAdd">Edit-Add</a>
command.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows the Add dialog for selecting the new file element
to be added to the archive.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances you would simply
select a file element and add this to the archive file, replacing any existing
element of the same name within the archive.&nbsp; For further information and a
detailed description of the Add screen options, see the <a href="add.html">Add

command.&nbsp; Figure 4 shows the Extract dialog.&nbsp; This is used to select
the archive file element to be extracted from the archive.&nbsp; Under normal
circumstances you would simply extract all file elements from the archive and
write them into a file directory, replacing any existing element of the same
name.&nbsp; For further information and a detailed description of the Extract
screen options, see the <a href="extract.html">Extract Functions</a> document.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There are times when you will seek to find a particular element
or set of elements within the archive file.&nbsp; The <a href="menu.html#EditFind">Edit-Find</a>
command can be used to show a selection dialog in which you can enter the name
of a file element, or partial name of an element.&nbsp; Figure 5 is an example
of a Find dialog.</font></p>
