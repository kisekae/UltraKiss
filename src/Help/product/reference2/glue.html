<h4><a name="glue" id="glue"></a>glue()&nbsp;</h4>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Syntax:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glue(child,parent)</p>
<p>The glue action command creates an attachment relationship between two group objects. The child group object is glued to the parent group object.  With
standard attachments when the parent object is moved all children move with the parent, but when a child is moved the attachment to the parent is broken.
When glued, if the child is moved the attachment is not broken so further movement of the parent also moves the child.</p>

<p>If the child object is glued to a different parent object then the attachment to the original parent is broken and the child is glued to the new parent object.
Note that an object can have many children but a child can only have one parent.</p>

<p>Restrictions on parent object movement do not apply to child objects.  If the parent object is moved its children can move outside the restricted area
for the parent.  If a child is restricted and the parent object with an attached child moves, and the child reaches a restriched boundary then the attachment
between the parent and the child is broken.</p>

<p>It is possible to create an attachment chain.  A child object can be glued ar attached to a parent object.  This child object can also be a parent to another object.  When an atachment chain exists movement of the top parent object moves all attached children.  Movement of a glued child does not break the attachment to its parent.  All the children of the child remain attached to the child.</p>

<p>Attached objects which have a positive fix value have strong attachments.
Attaching an object with a positive fix value to another object is similar to
tightly gluing the objects together, except that the fix count can change through normal
mouse actions and allow the object to eventually detach when the fix count
reaches zero.&nbsp;A fixed attachment solidifies the link. This lets the child
and its parent move together by dragging the child.
</p>

<p>Therefore, picking up a child object with a positive fix count will allow
combined movement of the object and its parent, if the parent object is
movable. If the parent object is also fixed then the combined set cannot move.
However, if the parent is attached to another parent itself, then only if this
new parent object is mobile can the combined set move. To summarize, if the top
level parent and all direct children in the chain are fixed, then the chain
cannot move, but if any parent is mobile then the fixed chain can be broken at
the unfixed object and the resultant chain dragged by
its children.
</p>

<p>When movement restrictions are in place, object detachment can occur both
under mouse movement and FKiSS movement.
For example, if a table and attached objects like cups and saucers is being moved as a unit and one
of the cups and saucers has a movement restriction in force, then the cup and
saucer can detach from the parent table object if the table moves beyond the restriction bounds. This detachment
can only occur if the attached object fix value is
zero. If the attached object has a positive fix value then the movement
restriction will stop the parent object from moving beyond the restriction
bounds.
</p>
<p>In the case of a hierarchical gluement chain, where object A is attached to
object B which is attached to object C and so on, the attach and fix restrictions
apply separately to each attachment link in the chain. For example, if object A
has a positive fix value and is glueed to object B, and object B is not fixed
yet is attached to object C, then picking up and dragging object A will break
the attachment link between object B and C, unless glued. This will cause a detached() event
to fire for object B. Similarly, if the attached chain was being moved by
dragging the parent object C and object A had movement restrictions set, then
the link between object B and C would be broken when the movement restrictions
on A were reached and a detached() event will fire for object B.
</p>

<p>Detached() events are performed while dragging after all mouse down events
have been recognized and before mouse up events are examined. More than one
detached() event can exist for the same object and these events will be
scheduled in the same order as the exist in the configuration file. Note that
there is no defined order for event processing in KiSS. The detached() event is
asynchronous and single threaded
viewers that do not support concurrent events can process the detached()
event at any time. Furthermore, multiple detachments can occur in any sequence.
No assumptions should be made for the sequence in which mouse events, unfix(), detached(), and
collision events are processed.
