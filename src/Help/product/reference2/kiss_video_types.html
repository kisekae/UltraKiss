<title>KiSS Video Types</title>

<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">KiSS Video Types</font></h2>
<p>When KiSS was invented in the early 1990's, computer video did not exist. Some early
KiSS artists did try to implement movie type capabilities by animating series of
images, but techniques today would incorporate movie format cels or
animated graphic images in KiSS sets. KiSS viewers have not progressed to this
point and UltraKiss is the only viewer to provide
the artist with ways to experiment with such capabilities.</p>
<p>Movies are video cels defined with an AVI or MPG extension for a supported
video file type. Such cels are essentially indistinguishable from standard image
cels, except that they may include playback controls and other features to
manage presentation.</p>
<p>The ability to play movies is an experimental feature of a KiSS viewer.
Music and sound and movies are all separate entities and playback of movie files is distinct
from sound files.</p>
<p>Movie files
should be played concurrently. The movie(&quot;&quot;) command with no
file name specified will stop all movie playback
instantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Compatibility:</font></b></p>
<p>UltraKiss is the only viewer to experiment with video cels and animated
graphic cels. </p>
<p>UltraKiss introduced the <a href="movie.html">movie()</a> action
command to allow for playback and control of video cels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">FKiSS 5 extensions:</font></b></p>
<p>FKiSS 5 introduces the <a href="mediastart.html">mediastart()</a> and <a href="movie.html">mediastop()
</a> events to facilitate
control of media playback, including movies. Basic FKiSS is deficient in that
media playback can be initiated through the sound() or music() action command, but no process
exists to recognize when such files stopped or started.</p>
