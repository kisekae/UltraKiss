<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">KiSS Image Types</font></h2>
<p>The original KiSS specification defined one image format, known as CEL, to
represent image pixel data. Perhaps the biggest problem with CEL images is that
palette type encodings do not contain a color table as part of the image file,
therefore a separate color file must be referenced in order to properly display
the image. This is known as a KiSS Color File, or KCF file. Because the
separation of colors from data introduced management difficulties for keeping
track of pixel data and color data, CEL images have not become a widely
recognized or useful image format.</p>
<p>KiSS color files are capable of storing multiple color maps, or palette
groups. With KCF files different colors can now be applied to the same pixel data, or different
images can now refer to the same color file. Changes to image coloring can now
be made by choosing a different color map from the file. Unfortunately, the change could
potentially apply to a number of images. This could lead to confusion and
application maintenance difficulties as some images could have a different
number of color maps from other images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to specify different color maps or palettes is a basic feature of
a KiSS viewer. The original KiSS implementation limited the maximum number
of color maps in a KCF file to 10, although this is not a necessary requirement. UltraKiss supports an unlimited number of color palettes. </p>
<p>CEL images are uncompressed. Therefore, KiSS sets of images are typically
packaged in LZH format archive files to minimize space requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Compatibility:</font></b></p>
<p>CEL and KCF image file formats are not included in standard image processing
tools. KiSS sets must be built from standard image formats or standard formats
must be converted to CEL and KCF files.&nbsp; This conversion is complex and
error prone. FKiSS 5 enables industry standard BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, PPM, PBM, and
PGM images formats for use as KiSS cels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LZH format archive files are uncommon. Support for ZIP file compression is
now standard across all operating systems. FKiSS 5 allows KiSS sets to be
packaged in standard ZIP format for ease of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">FKiSS 5 extensions:</font></b></p>
<p>FKiSS 5 should allow for any type of image file. No restriction should exist
on the maximum number of palettes in a KCF file.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to document LZH header formats as well as changes made for features not yet implemented. Corrections, additions and suggestions
are always welcomed. Header fields in Italics are currently under development for Huffman Compression Engine only, and should be ignored (skipped) if not

LZH format<br>
Byte Order: Little-endian&nbsp;<br>
There are 3 types of LZH headers, level-0, level-1, and level-2.&nbsp;<br>
All .lzh and .lha files are null terminated. The last byte of the file should be&nbsp;<br>
a 0, but if it's not, it will be interpreted as null terminated. The reason for&nbsp;<br>
this termination is that it implies that the next header-size is zero. Huffman&nbsp;<br>
Compression Engine adds the null but doesn't need it.<br>

Handling of extended headers.<br>
Proper procedure for handling of extended headers can be summed up in virtual&nbsp;<br>
code:<br>
<br>
    Read the first 21 bytes of the real header to determine the size of the&nbsp;<br>
    first extended header. If the&nbsp;<br>
    Use the first extended header in the loop that reads subsequent headers&nbsp;<br>
    Assign this value to a variable which is used inside the extended header&nbsp;<br>
    loop&nbsp;<br>
    Repeat&nbsp;<br>
    Allocate enough memory for the header&nbsp;<br>
    Read the header into the array&nbsp;<br>
    Assign headersize to a word variable at the last 2 bytes of the array&nbsp;<br>
    Goto 3&nbsp;<br>
    Handle compressed data if it exists.<br>

            from 0.21d to 0.21M and was actually -lh7- per Harihiko's review of&nbsp;<br>
            Yoshi's notes.<br>
            "-lhd-"Directory (no compressed data). This signature may not&nbsp;<br>
            contain any information at all. In some cases it only is used to&nbsp;<br>
            signify that there are extended headers with important information.&nbsp;<br>
            In level 0 archives it most likely contains the directory for the&nbsp;<br>
            next header's file, but in level 1 and 2 headers, it most likely&nbsp;<br>
            contains nothing except for possibly the size of the first extended&nbsp;<br>
            header.<br>
<br>
Huffman Compression Engine II dynamically sets the method for compression based&nbsp;<br>
on the file size. Reasoning: It makes little sense to use a 64KB buffer if the&nbsp;<br>
file is 1K. The next section covers variances, which basically define what to do&nbsp;<br>
in known cases where the file signature does not match the dictionary size.<br>
<br>
Variances<br>
Huffman Compression Engine II<br>
Versions after 0.21M now dynamically size the dictionary buffer according to the&nbsp;<br>
size of the file to be compressed. It is not uncommon to have signatures of&nbsp;<br>
-lh4- thru -lh7-. A future implementation will include -lh9- through -lhc- and&nbsp;<br>
-lhe-, which represent dictionary sizes of 128KB through 2MB. -lhd- is skipped&nbsp;<br>
due to the fact that it is a reserved signature. During 0.21, a misunderstanding&nbsp;<br>
about the method identifier lead me to think that a 64KB buffer was -lh8-.&nbsp;<br>
Although logic dictated that it should be, 16KB dictionaries were bypassed&nbsp;<br>
entirely, which lead to this confusion. In order to simplify the problem, decode&nbsp;<br>
should use 64KB for -lh6- through -lh8-.<br>

This specifies that the information following this header contains a complete&nbsp;<br>

This specifies that the information following this header is incomplete. The&nbsp;<br>

SPAN_COMPLETE. This specifies that the information following this header&nbsp;<br>
contains a complete (optionally compressed) file. This is often unused<br>
because MDF is not needed in these cases. In an unsplit file, the header&nbsp;<br>
information and format should follow the standard LZH format.<br>
<br>
SPAN_MORE. This specifies that the information following this header is&nbsp;<br>
incomplete. The uncompressor needs to concatenate this segment with<br>
information from the following volume. It should continue to do that until it&nbsp;<br>
sees a volume with a header information that contains span_mode<br>
SPAN_LAST.<br>
<br>
SPAN_LAST. This specifies that the information following this header is the last&nbsp;<br>
segment of the (optionally compressed) file.<br>
<br>
<br>
beginning_offset: This value specifies the location in bytes of where this&nbsp;<br>
segment (run) of information will fit into.<br>
<br>
size_of_run: This is the size of this segment of information.<br>
<br>
<br>

The illustration below contain two volumes with two compressed files, one of&nbsp;<br>
them split between the two volumes. "File 1" is compressed and fits<br>
within the first volume. "File 2" is a file 100 bytes long compressed to 90&nbsp;<br>
bytes. The first 50 bytes of which resides on the first volume and the<br>
last 40 bytes on the next.<br>

Termination<br>
-----------<br>
In addition to the above changes, the compressor must before closing the file&nbsp;<br>
after writing the last volume, write a null byte at the end of the file. This&nbsp;<br>
byte serves to inform the decompressor that this is the last volume and no other&nbsp;<br>
comes after it.<br>
<br>
This end of volume byte is needed to tell the decompressor when to stop&nbsp;<br>
prompting for the next volume. This termination byte is optional, as the&nbsp;<br>
decompressor may also stop when it has completed a file, i.e., see SPAN_LAST or&nbsp;<br>
just a regular file with<br>
MDF. However if the end of this completed file coincides with an end of volume,&nbsp;<br>
there would be not way for the compressor detect that the following<br>
volumes and prompt for them.<br>
This termination byte is a way around this potential bug.<br>
<br>
Note that this null byte coincides with header_size in the LZH header.<br>
