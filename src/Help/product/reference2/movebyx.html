<h4><a name="movebyx" id="movebyx">move</a>byx()&nbsp;</h4>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Syntax:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; movebyx
(target,base,X[,noconstrain])</p>
<p>This action moves the target object or image cel to the leftmost location of the base object, offset by the pixel count specified in X. With a X offset value of 0, the target object will be positioned at the same horizontal location as the base object in the playfield. </p>
<p>The <em>target</em> may be a literal name of an image
  file or  an object group identifier, or a variable that contains an object number or cel image name. The target is the object that will move. </p>
<p>The <em>base </em> may be a literal name of an image file or an object group identifier, or a variable that contains an object number or cel image name, that specifies the base destination of  the target object. The actual movement is to a relative offest to this base location, specified by the  X parameter. The X value is an integer offset in pixel coordinates for the target. Offsets can be negative to locate the target to the left of the base object, or postitive to locate the target to the right of the base object. </p>
<p>The optional <em>noconstrain</em> parameter, if non-zero, allows unconstrained movement beyond the playfield boundaries. In most cases FKiSS object movement is constrained to the playfield boundaries, or within the playfield boundaries if restrictx() or restricty() commands have been applied to the object. This global playfield restriction can becontrolled through an UltraKiss program option. Negative offset values can move the object off the playfield if movement is not constrained.</p>
<p>Fixed and maximum fixed objects can always be moved with a move() command. Movement of an object with FKiSS does not affect the object fix count. </p>
<p>FKiSS object movement can affect objects under mouse control if the movement command is applied through alarms or other events that concurrently fire. The specification as to whether the mouse has control or the FKiSS command has control is not consistent between different viewers. UltraKiss provides two compatiblity options to manage this behaviour.</p>
<p>Collision events are recognized and processed  after the object or cel image has been moved. The KiSS specifications are poor and there is no clarity as to whether  collisions are supposed to be recognized after the each FKiSS action statement or after each FKiSS event has completed. Foe example, if an event was to move object A to point P and then move the object back to its starting position, should collision events be recognized at point P? UltraKiss provides a compatibility option to enable collision event recognition after each interim move() statement, or at the completion of the event at the final positions. </p>
<p>The movebyx() command is often paired with a movebyy() command to locate the target object to a point (X,Y) relative to a base object. This technique is commonly used for 'snap-to' functionallity, where an article of clothing is expected to be snapped into the proper position on a doll body in the event that the clothing is placed anywhere on the doll. One difficulty with the KiSS specification is that no single command was specified to perform a relative object movement in two dimensions as a single operation. Any 'snap-to'  behaviour had to be programmed as a movebyx() action followed by a movebyy() action. The expected result would be that a collision event would fire for either the movebyx() action or the movebyy() actions if the object intersected with another object during its two step path to its final destination. UltraKiss has introduced a compatibility option to prevent multiple collision events from firing in this situation.</p>
<p>If object movement is restricted through restrictx() or restricty() commands then the random movement is constrained by the restricted bounds. The object will move as close as possible to the required point. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>FKiSS 5 Extension:</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>UltraKiss FKiSS5 introduces the ability to move image cels within an object group. Previously, the move() command would only apply to objects. When image cels are moved the offset of the image within the object is changed. This offset change can adjust the size and location of the object group. Note that for object groups of one cel image only, a move() command for the cel image is logically equivalent to a move() command for the object group. </p>
<p>Cel movement applied to ambiguous cels, where the same cel image is in more than one object, should not be specified. </p>
