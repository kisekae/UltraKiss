<h4><a name="out">out</a>()&nbsp;</h4>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Syntax:</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out (target,target)</p>
<p>This event is triggered when the bounding boxes of the two objects no longer
overlap after a move, if they overlapped before. The target may be a literal name of an image
file or a cel group name or an object group identifier.</p>
<p>A cel must be mapped for a collision event to occur. Note that a mapped and completely transparent image
can trigger an
out() event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For cel group out() events, the event is triggered if no cel bounding box
overlaps when any cel bounding box overlapped before. In other words, bounding
boxes for all cels in the target groups are examined for overlap inclusion.</p>
<p>Collision events are triggered for movement with the mouse or movement by FKiSS
action commands. FKiSS movement of visible non-touching cels that are subsequently unmapped
and moved can trigger a collision event when the cel is mapped if the viewer
supports visibility collisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out() events are symmetric, out (#1, #2) is equivalent to out (#2, #1). Only one case need be specified and the event will trigger when
object group #1 no longer overlaps object group #2
or vice versa.</p>
<p>More than one out() event can be specified for a specific cel or object
group pair. If sequential event processing is enforced each event will fire in
the sequence in which it was defined, otherwise they are processed concurrently.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Out() events are triggered for movement with the mouse or movement by FKiSS
action commands. On mouse movement, collision events are identified by comparing
the collision state at the time the mouse button was pressed to the collision
state when the mouse button is released. An object passing through or over
another object as part of a mouse drag does not participate in a collision.</p>
<p>On FKiSS movement, object collisions can be recognized on an individual
action command basis or on an event granularity basis. For action commands,
collisions are recognized by comparing the object collision state at the start
of the command to the state after the command is processed. For event
granularity, collisions are recognized by comparing the object collision state
at the beginning of the event to the state when the event terminates. Event
granularity will not recognize interim collisions when an object is moved,
collides with another object, and then is restored to its original location
within the same event. Action command granularity may fire duplicate collisions
if an object is moved multiple times within an event, as could happen with
movebyx() and movebyy() action commands.</p>
<p>Viewers implement collision processing in different ways.&nbsp; Some viewers
will recognize collisions on a command basis and others on an event basis. Some
viewers will also execute collision event code immediately, interrupting the
primary event, rather than interpreting the collision as a separately specified
event. These differences all lead to viewer incompatibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that there is no defined order for event processing in KiSS. Single threaded viewers that do not support concurrent events will typically
process the out() event after collide() and apart() events and after any in()
event, and before stillin() and stillout() variants. No assumptions should be made for the sequence in
which events are processed.</p>
