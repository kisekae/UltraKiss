<h4><a name="restricty" id="restricty">restricty()</a>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Syntax:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restricty(group,minY,maxY)</p>
<p>This action restricts the group object vertical movement to the boundaries specified. The restriction boundaries 
apply to the location of the group object which is defined as the upper left corner of the visible group bounding box.
If the group object is not within the restricted area then it will be moved to satisfy the restriction.
If the group object is attached to another object then it is the parent object that is moved sufficiently 
to satisfy the restriction.  If the restriction cannot be satisfied because of an attached child restriction 
then all restricted children are detached.  The vertical restriction is removed from the group object if the maximum
boundary value is less than the minimum boundary value.</p>
<p>The <em>group</em> must be a variable containing a group number or a literal name of group object.
 The <em>minY</em> and <em>maxY</em> arguments must be integer values or variables that evaluate to integer values.</p>
<p>Fixed and maximum fixed objects can always be moved with a restricty() command. Movement of an object with FKiSS does
 not affect the object fix count. </p>
<p>FKiSS object movement can affect objects under mouse control if the restriction command is applied through alarms 
or other events that concurrently fire. The specification as to whether the mouse has control or the FKiSS command has 
control is not consistent between different viewers. UltraKiss provides two compatiblity options to manage this behaviour.</p>
<p>Collision events are recognized and processed after the object has been moved. The KiSS specifications are poor and 
there is no clarity as to whether  collisions are supposed to be recognized after the each FKiSS action statement or 
after each FKiSS event has completed. For example, if an event was to move object A to point P and then move the 
object back to its starting position, should collision events be recognized at point P? UltraKiss provides a 
compatibility option to enable collision event recognition after each interim move() statement, or at the completion 
of the event at the final positions. </p>
<p>The restricty() command is often paired with a restrictx() command to establish a restricted movement box. 
One difficulty with the KiSS specification is that no single command was specified to perform a relative object 
movement in two dimensions as a single operation. The expected result would be that a collision event would fire 
for either the restrictx() action or the restricty() actions if the object intersected with another object during 
its two step path to its final destination. UltraKiss has introduced a compatibility option to prevent multiple 
collision events from firing in this situation.</p>
<p>If object movement is restricted through restrictx() or restricty() commands then the random movement is constrained 
by the restricted bounds. The object will move as close as possible to the required point. </p>
