Introduction
Every effort has been made to document LZH header formats as well as changes 
made for features not yet implemented. Corrections, additions and suggestions 
are always welcomed. Header fields in Italics are currently under development 
for Huffman Compression Engine only, and should be ignored (skipped) if not 
supported, as should any extended header. If you are a developer of compression 
utilities in .lzh file formats, please feel free to jump in and help.

LZH format
Byte Order: Little-endian 
There are 3 types of LZH headers, level-0, level-1, and level-2. 
All .lzh and .lha files are null terminated. The last byte of the file should be 
a 0, but if it's not, it will be interpreted as null terminated. The reason for 
this termination is that it implies that the next header-size is zero. Huffman 
Compression Engine adds the null but doesn't need it.

In all cases, read the first 21 bytes of the header. After determining the 
header type, you will then have to handle the header as needed or suggested.

Level 2 header structure
OffsetSize in bytesDescription
            12Total size of headers, including Extended headers for this entry.
            This field is unimportant as long as the extended headers are looped 
            appropriately. For compatibility with other archivers however, a 
            variable should be assigned to add up the size of each extended 
            header.

            This value excludes the size of all Extended headers and only refers 
            to the actual compressed data. This is an improvement, and can be 
            problematic if not handled properly.

            Note: Extended headers are not optional, and have no preset maximum. 
            Minimum compatibility should include a type1 extended header.
            The first byte of an extended header identifies the type of header, 
            and the last 2 bytes of the header identify whether or not more 
            headers are defined. Huffman Compression Engine will use the 
            extended header filename if both exist in level 1 archives. Your 
            loop for reading of these headers should include offset 24 for the 
            first assignment and loop until extended header size = 0.

Handling of extended headers.
Proper procedure for handling of extended headers can be summed up in virtual 
code:
 
    Read the first 21 bytes of the real header to determine the size of the 
    first extended header. If the 
    Use the first extended header in the loop that reads subsequent headers 
    Assign this value to a variable which is used inside the extended header 
    loop 
    Repeat 
    Allocate enough memory for the header 
    Read the header into the array 
    Assign headersize to a word variable at the last 2 bytes of the array 
    Goto 3 
    Handle compressed data if it exists.
Code has not been supplied intentionally. It is expected that the programmer 
reading this document has enough knowledge of programming to perform the task of 
writing real code.

            Yoshi's notes.
            "-lhd-"Directory (no compressed data). This signature may not 
            contain any information at all. In some cases it only is used to 
            signify that there are extended headers with important information. 
            In level 0 archives it most likely contains the directory for the 
            next header's file, but in level 1 and 2 headers, it most likely 
            contains nothing except for possibly the size of the first extended 
            header.

Huffman Compression Engine II dynamically sets the method for compression based 
on the file size. Reasoning: It makes little sense to use a 64KB buffer if the 
file is 1K. The next section covers variances, which basically define what to do 
in known cases where the file signature does not match the dictionary size.
 
Variances
Huffman Compression Engine II
Versions after 0.21M now dynamically size the dictionary buffer according to the 
size of the file to be compressed. It is not uncommon to have signatures of 
-lh4- thru -lh7-. A future implementation will include -lh9- through -lhc- and 
-lhe-, which represent dictionary sizes of 128KB through 2MB. -lhd- is skipped 
due to the fact that it is a reserved signature. During 0.21, a misunderstanding 
about the method identifier lead me to think that a 64KB buffer was -lh8-. 
Although logic dictated that it should be, 16KB dictionaries were bypassed 
entirely, which lead to this confusion. In order to simplify the problem, decode 
should use 64KB for -lh6- through -lh8-.

Compatibility with the above links can only be guessed at this point, as few lha 
style compressors support anything above -lh5-. However, if your interest is in 
maintaining compatibility with these other platforms, -K5 added to the command

The following is a planned implementation. The original can be found at:

}
 
span_mode: This identifies the mode of this segment of file. The values are:
#define SPAN_COMPLETE 0
#define SPAN_MORE 1
#define SPAN_LAST 2
 
SPAN_COMPLETE. 
This specifies that the information following this header contains a complete 
(optionally compressed) file. This is often unused because MDF is not needed in 
these cases. In an unsplit file, the header information and format should follow 
the standard LZH format.
 
SPAN_MORE. 
This specifies that the information following this header is incomplete. The 
uncompressor needs to concatenate this segment with
information from the following volume. It should continue to do that until it 
sees a volume with a header information that contains span_mode
SPAN_LAST
This specifies that the information following this header is the last segment of 
the (optionally compressed) file.
beginning_offset:
This value specifies the location in bytes of where this segment (run) of 
information will fit into.
 
size_of_run
This is the size of this segment of information.
 
span_mode: 
This identifies the mode of this segment of file. The values are:
#define SPAN_COMPLETE 0
#define SPAN_MORE 1
#define SPAN_LAST 2
 
SPAN_COMPLETE. This specifies that the information following this header 
contains a complete (optionally compressed) file. This is often unused
because MDF is not needed in these cases. In an unsplit file, the header 
information and format should follow the standard LZH format.
 
SPAN_MORE. This specifies that the information following this header is 
incomplete. The uncompressor needs to concatenate this segment with

sees a volume with a header information that contains span_mode
SPAN_LAST.
 
SPAN_LAST. This specifies that the information following this header is the last 
segment of the (optionally compressed) file.
 
 
beginning_offset: This value specifies the location in bytes of where this 
segment (run) of information will fit into.
 
size_of_run: This is the size of this segment of information.
 
 
 
The illustration below contain two volumes with two compressed files, one of 
them split between the two volumes. "File 1" is compressed and fits
within the first volume. "File 2" is a file 100 bytes long compressed to 90 
bytes. The first 50 bytes of which resides on the first volume and the
last 40 bytes on the next.

Termination
-----------
In addition to the above changes, the compressor must before closing the file 
after writing the last volume, write a null byte at the end of the file. This 
byte serves to inform the decompressor that this is the last volume and no other 
comes after it.
 
This end of volume byte is needed to tell the decompressor when to stop 
prompting for the next volume. This termination byte is optional, as the 
decompressor may also stop when it has completed a file, i.e., see SPAN_LAST or 
just a regular file with
MDF. However if the end of this completed file coincides with an end of volume, 
there would be not way for the compressor detect that the following
volumes and prompt for them.
This termination byte is a way around this potential bug.
 
Note that this null byte coincides with header_size in the LZH header.
