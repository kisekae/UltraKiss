<h1><font color="#FF0000">Color Editor Menu Commands</font></h1>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to the Kisekae Color Editor program documentation. The Color Editor
menu provides a
standard drop down list of commands for all palette editing functions.&nbsp;</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 align="left"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial"> File Menu</font></h2>
<font face="Arial">
The File menu has commands to load, save, and print KiSS palette files.&nbsp; The File menu also contains commands to display current
palette file properties.</font><p><font face="Arial">The Kisekae Color Editor can load any KiSS image file
or palette file, including non-palette files such as truecolor or Cherry Kiss files.&nbsp;
Truecolor files do not
have palettes, however these images can still be previewed and some
transparency settings can be changed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileNew"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">New</font></a></h3>
<font face="Arial">
The New command has two variants.  New palettes can be created or new palette
groups within a palette can be created.</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">New Palette</font></b>

<p><font face="Arial">New palettes are created from the New menu on the Color Editor main program
screen.&nbsp; 16 color or 256 color palettes can be created.&nbsp; New palettes
are initialized to a standard set of colors.&nbsp; 16 color palettes are
initialized to 8 variants of grey and 8 standard colors.&nbsp; 256 color
palettes are initialized to the default colors of a 16 color palette, followed
by 240 new colors that span the color circle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">New palette files can be saved to a named file directory
through the <a href="#FileSaveAs">File-Save As</a> command.&nbsp; Palette files can
be saved as KiSS KCF files or PAL files.&nbsp; If a palette is saved a new file
is written to the named file directory.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Arial">New Palette Group</font></b>

<p><font face="Arial">New palette groups are created from the New menu after a palette file has
been
loaded or created within the Color Editor program.&nbsp; A new palette group has
the same number of colors as currently exist in the palette.&nbsp; It is not
possible to create a 16 color palette group within a 256 color palette, or vice
versa.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">New palette groups are initialized to the standard set of colors as described
for a new palette.&nbsp; The new palette group is assigned the next consecutive
palette group number within the palette.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileOpen"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Open...</font></a></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The Open command is used to open an existing KiSS palette file or any other
type of image file recognized by the Kisekae
UltraKiss program.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 1 shows a standard Microsoft Windows file Open dialog.&nbsp;
The file Open dialog can be used to select any file.&nbsp; If the selected file is of a
palette or image type recognized by the Kisekae program then the file will be
opened.&nbsp;
If the file is a compressed archive file the archive is searched for KiSS
palette files or image files.&nbsp;
If the file is not of a type recognized by the program then an error message
will be displayed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="images/menu_01.gif" width="425" height="263"></font></p>
<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 1. Open Dialog</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The example in Figure 1 selected the archive file TESTSET.LZH.&nbsp; When
opening archive files, the Color Editor will display a selection list of
suitable archive elements.&nbsp;These elements will be palette files or image
files.&nbsp; If a palette file or an image file that contains an internal
palette is selected then this element will be
automatically loaded.&nbsp;
If a KiSS cel file is selected then a second selection list will be shown to
choose the appropriate KiSS KCF or PAL file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 2 shows a
palette selection dialog for the TESTSET.LZH file and a palette selection dialog
for the cel 0-BEGIN.CEL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 2. Palette Selection</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the palette file and the associated image cel is selected the files are opened and processed.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows a
the Color Editor with a KiSS cel and palette file loaded.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 3. Color Editor Window</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The active palette file name is shown in the Palette drop down box.&nbsp; The
active image is shown in the Image Cel drop down box.&nbsp; The palette group in
use is shown in the Palette Group drop down box.&nbsp; If a truecolor image has
been loaded&nbsp; the Palette drop down box will be
blank.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileClose"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Close</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Close command is used to close the currently active palette or image
file.&nbsp;If the palette has been updated or
modified the user will be prompted to save the current palette file or image cel.&nbsp; Figure 4
is an example of a close prompt dialog.&nbsp; Cancelling the save will cancel the
close request.&nbsp; If the palette file is to be saved&nbsp; the <a href="#FileSaveAs">File-Save As</a> command
is invoked.&nbsp; If not, the close operation will continue and all changes are
lost.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 4. Close Prompt Dialog</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Files loaded from a compressed archive are written to the original archive
file from which they were loaded.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileSave"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">KiSS data sets are, by default, saved to the file directory or compressed archive file
from which they were loaded.&nbsp; For example, if a palette file or image cel was loaded from
an archive file then any updated elements will be written to this archive
file.&nbsp; If the files were loaded from a file
directory then the Save operation writes all updated elements into this
directory.&nbsp; For data sets loaded from
a compressed archive file the complete archive file is completely
rewritten, replacing all updated elements in the archive.&nbsp; For data sets
loaded from a directory only the updated element files are written.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save operation is performed in the background.&nbsp; Figure 5 shows the file save window that
tracks the progress of the write operation.&nbsp; The save operation may be
cancelled at any time.&nbsp; If an error occurs an appropriate
message will be displayed and the save operation will be cancelled.&nbsp; If the
save operation is successful the dialog window will be automatically closed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img border="0" src="images/menu_06.gif" width="400" height="200"></font></p>
<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 5. File Save Window</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that files are written to temporary files on disk and then renamed to the permanent
file name if the save operation is successful.&nbsp; This ensures that backup
file copies exist in the event of a program error.&nbsp; The backup file is
normally deleted upon completion of a successful save. Backups can be retained
permanently if the UltraKiss <a href="../kisekae/options.html#KeepFileBackup">Keep File Backup</a> program option has been set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileSaveAs"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save As...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save As operation provides a means to save the currently loaded palette
file to a new file.&nbsp; If the file was loaded from a compressed
archive file then the Save As function will save the complete data set&nbsp; to a new compressed archive
file name.&nbsp; If the file was loaded from a file
directory then the Save As function can specify a new name for the palette element.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 6 shows a standard Microsoft Windows file Save
As dialog.  The Color Editor Save As dialog will only accept element file names.&nbsp;
You cannot change the name of the archive file from which the palette element
was loaded.&nbsp; To change archive file names, use the <a href="../archivemanager/index.html"> Archive Manager</a> tool.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save operation proceeds as described in the <a href="#FileSave">File-Save</a>
command.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileImport"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Import...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Import command is used to initialize the palette to the contents of
another KiSS palette file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Importing colors from an external palette
file replaces all palette groups within the current palette.&nbsp; This
operation can be used to quickly and easily set palette values to the same
values as some other palette.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Palettes are imported from external KiSS KCF files or PAL files.&nbsp; You cannot import palettes from
image files such as GIF or BMP images.&nbsp; The File Open dialog as shown
in Figure 1 is used to select the file to be imported.&nbsp; You can choose to
import palette files from archive files or directory files.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you open a compressed archive you must select a palette file from a
selection dialog as shown in Figure 2.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the file is imported all palette groups in the current palette will be
replaced and the preview image will be adjusted to show the colors from the new
active palette group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Import command is undoable.&nbsp; The Edit-Undo function can be used to
reverse the file import and restore the active palette to its previous state.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileExport"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Export...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Export command is used to write the active palette contents to an
external KiSS PAL file.&nbsp;&nbsp; A PAL file is a text form of the
KiSS palette.&nbsp; This text representation shows the numeric RGB values for
all colors in each palette group of a KiSS palette.&nbsp; PAL files are
useful for manual editing of color values.&nbsp; The edited values can be
imported back into a KiSS palette file.&nbsp; Figure 7 shows an extract of a PAL
file.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileMerge"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Merge...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Merge command is used to append the contents of another KiSS palette file
to the current palette.&nbsp;&nbsp; Merged palettes have traditionally been used
in KiSS data sets to create one palette file that contains all the colors for
many different image cels.&nbsp; An image cel would refer to a different palette
group within the merged palette on its configuration line.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Palettes are merged from external KiSS KCF files or PAL files.&nbsp; You cannot merge palettes from image
files such as GIF or BMP images.&nbsp; The File Open dialog as shown
in Figure 1 is used to select the file to be merged.&nbsp; You can choose to
merge palette files from archive files or directory files.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you open a compressed archive you must select a palette file from a
selection dialog as shown in Figure 2.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the file is merged a new set of palette groups will be added to the
current palette.&nbsp; These palette groups will show in the Palette Group drop
down box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Merge command is undoable.&nbsp; The Edit-Undo function can be used to
reverse the file merge and restore the active palette to its previous state.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FilePageSetup"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Page Setup...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Page Setup dialog is an operating system dependent interface into the
print control subsystem to size and orient the print page in preparation for
printing.&nbsp; Figure 8 shows the
Page Setup dialog for a Microsoft Windows operating environment.&nbsp; Not all
systems will support all features for page control.</font></p>

<h3><a name="FilePrintPreview"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Print Preview...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Print Preview command is used to preview all print pages before
printing.&nbsp; Figure 9 shows an
example of the Color Editor Print Preview screen.&nbsp; The Color Editor will center
and scale the current page image on the print page.&nbsp; The preview image
of the print page can be scaled to any size required by changing the percentage
value in the preview control field.&nbsp; Preset values of 10%, 25%, 50% and
100% are provided for convenience.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The <a href="#FilePageSetup">Page Setup</a> can be changed from this dialog

<h3><a name="FileProperties"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Properties...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Properties command shows a standard dialog window to display attributes
of the currently loaded KiSS palette file.&nbsp; Figure 11 is an example of a KiSS
palette properties dialog.&nbsp; This
dialog provides detailed information on the technical aspects of the active
palette file and provides control buttons to view additional information about
associated data objects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The properties command will show palette properties for KiSS palette
files loaded into the Color Editor.&nbsp; The properties command will show an
image properties dialog for GIF or BMP or truecolor images that were loaded into the Color Editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

subsystem for a comprehensive description of all subsystem features, dialogs,
and operation control.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileUpdate"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Update</font></a></h3>



<p><font face="Arial">The Update command is used to apply palette editing changes to the currently
loaded UltraKiss configuration.&nbsp; The Update command is only available if
the Color Editor is editing an active palette or image file that was referenced
from within UltraKiss.&nbsp; Updating the UltraKiss configuration does not
terminate the Color Editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">You would use the Update command to test your color changes within UltraKiss.
These color updates are undoable, so if the results are not satisfactory you can
undo the change within UltraKiss and continue with your Color Editor session.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">Updated files reside in memory.&nbsp; The changes are not permanently until
the active configuration is saved.&nbsp; To permanently save the updated file, use the <a href="#FileSave">File-Save</a>
command.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a name="FileExit"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Exit</font></a></h3>



<p><font face="Arial">The Exit command closes any currently active data set and terminates the
Color Editor program execution.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">If the palette or image file in the Color Editor has been updated or
modified the user will be prompted to either save the current data set or update
the currently active configuration depending on the source of the palette or
image file.&nbsp; Source files that were loaded through an UltraKiss session can
be directly updated in memory.&nbsp; Files that were explicitly opened from a
different archive file or directory can be saved to disk.&nbsp; Figure 4
is an example of a close prompt dialog.&nbsp; Cancelling the save will cancel the
exit request.&nbsp; If the current file is saved&nbsp; then the <a href="#FileSaveAs">File-Save As</a> command
is invoked and the Color Editor program will terminate upon completion of the save.&nbsp; If
changes are not saved they will be
lost.&nbsp;</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">If the Color Editor program is terminated by closing the window the
Exit command will be automatically invoked.&nbsp; The option
to cancel the Exit request will not be available.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 align="left"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial"> Edit Menu</font></h2>
<font face="Arial">
The Kisekae Color Editor provides for full undo and redo recovery of all editing operations applied to the current
palette file.  Standard Edit functions to Cut, Copy, and Paste selected colors within and between
palette groups are available. Transparent and background colors can be
changed.&nbsp; New palette groups can be created or deleted, and external
palette files can be imported and merged.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Many edit commands operate with a selected set of colors.&nbsp; Colors are
selected through the <a href="#EditSelectAll">Edit-Select All</a> command or
graphically with a mouse selection operation.&nbsp; A mouse selection operation
is performed by positioning the mouse over a color in the palette and pressing the left mouse
button.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Selected colors are visually identifiable.&nbsp; Each selected color shows a
red border around the palette entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If a selection set exists new colors can be added to the selection set by
placing the mouse over the new object and pressing the left mouse button while
holding the Ctrl key down.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Colors can be removed from an existing selection set by placing the mouse

<h3><a name="EditUndo"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Undo</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Color Editor supports full undo and redo edit recovery.&nbsp; Most editing changes
made to a KiSS palette file are reversible.&nbsp; Undo support is available for Edit
Cut, Copy, and Paste operations.&nbsp; Transparency and background color changes
can be undone.&nbsp; Palette group additions and deletions
can be undone.&nbsp; Color selections can be undone.&nbsp; Every undo operation
reverts the palette to its prior state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Color Editor supports full undo and redo edit recovery.&nbsp; Most editing changes
made to a KiSS palette file are reversible.&nbsp; Redo support is available for Edit
Cut, Copy, and Paste operations.&nbsp; Transparency and background color changes can be
redone.&nbsp; Palette group additions and deletions
can be redone.&nbsp; Color selections can be redone.&nbsp; Every redo operation
applies the previously undone edit to restore the palette to its former state.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditUndoAll"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Undo All</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Undo All command restores the palette contents to its initial state as of
load or last save.&nbsp; All edit changes are lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditCut"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Cut</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Cut operation will remove selected colors from the current palette.&nbsp;
Colors, when cut, are placed in the clipboard and can be referenced through a
subsequent <a href="#EditPaste">Edit-Paste</a> command.&nbsp; Cut colors are replaced

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditCopy"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Copy</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Copy operation copies selected colors to the clipboard.&nbsp; The colors
in the clipboard can be referenced through a subsequent <a href="#EditPaste">Edit-Paste</a>
command.&nbsp; Copied colors retain their order in the palette but are not
associated with a fixed color index.&nbsp; If colors are pasted into a palette
they will be placed into the current palette in the order of the current color selection set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditPaste"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Paste</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Paste operation transfers colors from the clipboard into the current
palette.&nbsp; Colors, when pasted, are inserted into the currently selected
color set of the palette.&nbsp; If the current selection set does not contain
the same number of colors as exist in the clipboard, then a warning message will
be displayed.&nbsp; If the paste operation is accepted the clipboard colors will
be copied in order into the selection set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the clipboard contains fewer colors than exist the selection set, only the
necessary colors in the selection set will be changed.&nbsp; If the clipboard
contains more colors than exist in the selection set, only sufficient colors
from the clipboard will be transferred.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditSelectAll"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Select All</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Select All command is used to select all colors in the current
palette.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditSelectCopy"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Select Copy</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Select Copy command is used to automatically select the specific color
indexes in the current palette as exist for all colors copied to the
clipboard.&nbsp; This command can be used to ensure that the actual copied color
indexes are retained for a subsequent paste
operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditSimilarHSB"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Select Similar HSB</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Select Similar HSB command is the menu command equivalent to pressing the
Hue, Saturation, or Brightness buttons on the Color Editor toolbar.&nbsp; This
command automatically selects similar colors in the palette that match, within
the defined sensitivity ranges, the HSB values of the current active
color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Selecting similar colors is one of the key functions of the Color
Editor.&nbsp; This function lets you choose related palette colors so that relative or
absolute color adjustments can be made to change color in a restricted
way.&nbsp; If you choose an active color and all related colors, then it is
possible to change these colors to new variants with the color
chooser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The best way to change the color of an image cel is to first select a pixel
in the preview image with the eyedropper, then select all 'similar' colors using
the Hue button. The sensitivity of the Hue or Saturation or Brightness button is
controlled with the little up-down arrows in the corner of the button. As you
increase the sensitivity value more and more colors from the palette will be
chosen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Once you have the colors selected, switch to the HSB panel of the color
chooser and drag the slider to a new hue. The preview image will change to show
the new colors. Pixel hues are adjusted based upon their relative differences
from the first, or active color that you selected with the eye dropper. Dark
colors remain dark and light colors remain light.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When new colors or tints are applied to the image relative adjustments are
made to color hue, brightness and saturation. If you use the color chooser and
significantly darken or lighten differences from the active color then some
related colors in the selection set may become 'saturated', or reach their limit
of change. If necessary, you can turn off relative brightness, saturation or hue
changes by right clicking on the appropriate button to disable it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the results in the preview window are not what you want then simply undo
the color change. If you missed selecting all the necessary colors, simply
increase the sensitivity on the Hue selection button and try again, or pick up a
different colored pixel from the preview image and use the Hue button to select
a different set of 'similar' colors. Best results occur if you initially select
a middle-of-the-road color for the active color.</font></p>

<h3><a name="EditSimilarRGB"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Select Similar RGB</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Select Similar RGB command is the menu command equivalent to pressing the
Red, Green, or Blue buttons on the Color Editor toolbar.&nbsp; This
command automatically selects similar colors in the palette that match, within
the defined sensitivity ranges, the RGB values of the current active
color.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Selecting similar colors is one of the key functions of the Color
Editor.&nbsp; This function lets you choose related palette colors so that relative or
absolute color adjustments can be made to change color in a restricted
way.&nbsp; If you choose an active color and all related colors, then it is
possible to change these colors to new variants with the color
chooser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">See the discussion for <a href="#EditSimilarHSB">Select Similar HSB</a> for
further details.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditSetColorCount"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Set Color Count...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Set Color Count function sets the maximum number of colors for the
palette file.&nbsp; Each palette group within the file will have the same number
of colors.&nbsp; The minimum number of colors is 1 and the maximum number of
colors is 256. Figure 13 shows the color count dialog.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/menu_13.gif" width="224" height="125"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure 13.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the number of colors in a palette is increased the new, appended colors
will all be initialized to black.&nbsp; If the number of colors is reduced all
extraneous colors are dropped.&nbsp; Reducing the color count truncates the
palette.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Setting the color count is an undoable operation.&nbsp; The original number
of colors can be restored through an Edit-Undo operation.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="EditSetTransparent"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Set Transparent Color...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The transparent color can be set or changed for any image loaded into the
Color Editor.&nbsp; For palette type images the transparent color will be one of
the colors in the palette.&nbsp; For truecolor images the transparent color can
be any color RGB value within the image.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Set Transparent command will show a color selection menu as seen in
Figure 14.&nbsp; This menu will show all palette colors for palette images, or
just the active color for truecolor images.&nbsp; The current transparent color
is highlighted in red.&nbsp; To select a new transparent color left click the
mouse while over one of the color swatches.&nbsp; To clear the transparent
color, right click the mouse.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Only one color in an image can be the transparent color.&nbsp;
By definition, KiSS cel palette images use color index 0 from the KiSS KCF
palette file as their transparent color.&nbsp; Although the Color Editor will
let you change the transparent color for KiSS cels, this new setting will not be
retained if the file is saved.&nbsp; GIF images allow any palette color to be
the transparent color and this setting will be retained if the GIF file is
saved.&nbsp; BMP images do not maintain transparency information.&nbsp;
UltraKiss will retain transparency settings for BMP files within the KiSS data
set configuration file when the configuration is saved.&nbsp; Truecolor images
such as Cherry Kiss cels maintain the transparent color within the image
data.&nbsp; 24 bit truecolor files such as PPM files and raw BMP files will
maintain the transparent color within the KiSS data set configuration
file.&nbsp; JPG files do not support transparency and, although you can set a
transparent color, this color may not remain transparent if the file is saved.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Set Transparent command is undoable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The background color can be set or changed for any image loaded into the
Color Editor.&nbsp; For palette type images the background color will be one of
the colors in the palette.&nbsp; For truecolor images the background color can
be any color RGB value within the image.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Set Background command will show a color selection menu as seen in Figure
15.&nbsp; This menu will show all palette colors for palette images, or just the
active color for truecolor images.&nbsp; The current background color is
highlighted in red.&nbsp; To select a new background color left click the mouse
while over one of the color swatches.&nbsp; To clear the background color, right

new active palette.&nbsp; If the last palette group in the palette is deleted,
then the first palette group in the file will become the new active palette.</font></p>
