<h2><b><a name="Introduction"><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Color Editor is a full featured palette editing program designed to manipulate KiSS data palettes
or graphical image file palettes for images used in KiSS data sets.  This online Help document provides
reference material for the various commands and options available within the Color Editor program.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><b><a name="Color Editor Main Screen"><font face="Arial">Color Editor Main Screen</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Color Editor main program screen is shown in Figure
1.&nbsp; The Color Editor program uses standard menu commands to load files, set program
options, select integrated tools, and display online help. We assume that the reader
is familiar with the use and operation of basic computer graphical user interfaces.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Color Editor is used to adjust individual palette colors.&nbsp; The Color
Editor loads and saves image palette files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure 1.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The color editor screen is divided into four sections.&nbsp; The upper left section contains a color chooser panel
to choose a color from a predefined set of color swatches.&nbsp; Colors may also
be selected by hue, saturation, or brightness, or by individually setting the red, green and blue color components.&nbsp; The selected color
becomes the current active color.&nbsp; The active color is shown on the menu bar and highlighted in
the palette panel.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The lower left section of the screen is the palette panel.&nbsp;
The palette panel displays color buttons for all colors defined in the palette.&nbsp;
Palettes can contain up to 256 colors.&nbsp; All palette colors selected for editing are highlighted with
red selection boxes around the color buttons.&nbsp; More than one color can be
selected at one time.&nbsp; All selected colors are referred to as the selection
set.&nbsp; New colors can be added to the selection set by clicking on a button
when the Ctrl key is down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colors can be removed from the selection
set by right clicking on a selected color.&nbsp; Consecutive colors
can be selected by clicking on a button while holding the Shift key down.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Only one color is the active color.&nbsp; The active
color is normally the first color chosen when a selection set&nbsp; is created.&nbsp; If a
selection set exists
the active color can be changed by holding the Ctrl key down while clicking on a selected color.&nbsp; The active color is important.&nbsp;
It is used when relative color difference changes are made to a set of selected
colors.&nbsp; For example, to change the hue or tint of all palette colors in
shades of blue, the various shades of blue must be selected within the
palette.&nbsp; One of these colors will be the primary active color.&nbsp;
When the color chooser is used to adjust the active color then all selected palette blue
colors will be changed using the relative color difference between the new color and the
current active color.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The upper right section of the color editor screen is the
palette and image selection panel.&nbsp; The palette drop down selection box
list all possible palette files within the currently accessed archive file or
directory.&nbsp; The image drop down selection box lists all images that can use
this palette.&nbsp; Palette files may be KiSS KCF palette files or GIF or BMP
images that contain internal palettes.&nbsp; If a KiSS palette file is being
edited the image drop down box will list all KiSS cel type images for this
palette.&nbsp; If an internal GIF or BMP palette is being edited the image drop
down box will list only the specific GIF or BMP image that defines this palette.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The palette group selection box is used to choose a specific
group within the palette file.&nbsp;&nbsp; KiSS KCF files can contain
multiple palettes.&nbsp; GIF and BMP images contain only one palette.&nbsp; If a
new palette group is selected the palette panel and preview image will be
adjusted to show the new palette colors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The lower right section of the color editor screen is the image
preview panel.&nbsp; The preview panel can be used to select a particular color
from the preview image.&nbsp; Selection tools are provided to select a region of
interest, magnify the image, pick up a color, or move the preview image in the
panel.&nbsp; The eyedropper tool is used to select an image color.&nbsp; Any
color selected with the eyedropper is highlighted in the palette panel and
becomes the new active color.</font></p>

<h2><b><a name="The Color Chooser"><font face="Arial">The Color Chooser</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">Color is measured in one of two different systems.&nbsp; The HSB system
assigns a hue, saturation, and brightness measure to every color.&nbsp;
The RGB system assigns a red, green, and blue color component to every
color.&nbsp; These systems are sufficient to represent most colors that
can be reasonably displayed on a computer.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Color Chooser is a tabbed panel that enables individual selection of
almost any color.&nbsp; The first pane is the swatch pane and allows color
selection from a predefined set of color swatches.&nbsp; A color swatch can be chosen by clicking on the appropriate
color and the
selected color will be applied to any existing palette selection set.&nbsp; The preview
image will be adjusted to use the new color.&nbsp; This color is saved in the
recently used table for reuse.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 2 shows how colors can be chosen based upon hue, saturation, and
brightness controls.&nbsp; Hue is one measure of color and represents an angle
around a 360 degree color circle.&nbsp; Hue values range from 0 to 360
degrees.&nbsp; Different hues are different colors.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The vertical bar shows all the colors of the rainbow and the
slider control beside the bar can be used to adjust hue values.&nbsp; If the slider
is moved the hue component of the color will change without adjusting the color
saturation or brightness components.&nbsp; Conversely, if the small white circle in the
color chooser panel is moved variations in color saturation and
brightness will occur without changing the hue.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The hue control is very useful for adjusting image colors.&nbsp;
The shade of blue in the sailor top preview image in Figure 2 has
been adjusted from the original color as seen in Figure 1.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure 2.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Figure 3 shows how the color chooser can be used to change color
saturation.&nbsp; Saturation measures how much color is applied, or the strength
of the color.&nbsp; Saturation is specified as a percentage from 0 to 100.&nbsp; If the
saturation is low the color will appear weak, or light.&nbsp; If saturation is
high the color will appear strong, or dark.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">If the small white circle is moved within the saturation color
pane the hue and brightness of the color can be changed without adjusting the
saturation component..</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure 3.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Figure 4 shows how color brightness can be adjusted.&nbsp;
Brightness is the third attribute of color in the HSB system.&nbsp; Brightness is
specified as a percentage from 0 to 100.&nbsp; Colors with low brightness are
dark.&nbsp; Colors with a high brightness are light.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">If the small white circle is moved within the brightness color
pane the hue and saturation of the color can be changed without adjusting the
brightness component.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The last color chooser tab can be used to set color RGB
values.&nbsp; Individual color values can be entered into the text boxes or
control sliders can be dragged to adjust the color component as seen in Figure
5.</font></p>

<h2><b><a name="The Palette Panel"><font face="Arial">The Palette Panel</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The palette panel identifies all colors in the palette file.&nbsp; Not all images
have palettes and if a non-palette image or truecolor image is loaded into the
Color Editor the palette panel will not be shown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 6 shows a new, default 256 color palette.&nbsp; This palette was
created through the File - New command.&nbsp; The default color palette provides
a set of standard grey colors, predefined colors, and a generic span of many hues
in the rainbow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">New colors can be added to the selection set by clicking on a button with the
Ctrl key down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colors can be removed from the selection set by
right clicking on a selected color.&nbsp; A series of consecutive colors can be
selected by clicking on a button while holding the Shift key down.</font></p>

<h2><b><a name="The Image Preview Pane"><font face="Arial">The Image Preview Pane</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The image preview pane provides direct visual feedback on the effect of color
changes on the image of interest.&nbsp; Four control buttons or icons can be
used to manipulate the preview image.&nbsp; The image in the preview pane can be
magnified, examined through a region of interest, or moved as required.&nbsp; A
specific color from the image can be picked up as the active color and
subsequently changed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">KiSS palette files can apply to one or more KiSS cels.&nbsp; If one
specific KiSS cel has been selected for color editing, changes to the
palette file can affect other cels in the data set.&nbsp; To minimize palette editing errors, if a KiSS palette file is loaded
into the color editor an image viewing option to view All Cels can be used to
preview all images concurrently in the preview pane.&nbsp; Figure 6 shows all cels
previewed for a KiSS palette file.&nbsp; It also
illustrates how a rectangular region of interest can be selected for
previewing a portion of the total image.</font></p>
