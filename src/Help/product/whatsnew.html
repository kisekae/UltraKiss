		<ol>
			<li>
                <font face="Arial">
				With this final release UltraKiss V1.0 implements limited support for FKiSS
				event synchronization.&nbsp;&nbsp; New FKiSS 5 commands				wait() and signal() can be
				used to set synchronization locks on FKiSS variables, and				sleep() can be used to suspend event execution for a specified time.<br>
              </font>
		  <li>
                <font face="Arial">
				Local FKiSS variables can now be used within all FKiSS events, including Label
				events. Selective use of local variables provides support for recursive label
				calls and FKiSS function calls. Local variables are preceded with an '@'
				character and are created with let() statements.&nbsp; Label events invoked
				through gosub() commands can return function values to the calling routine.<br>

		<p><font face="Arial"><b>UltraKiss V1.0 (beta 5)</b> introduces new features to define and use basic GUI
			components within KiSS sets.&nbsp; Release beta 5 has also introduced a new
			capability for file input and output.&nbsp; These features provide improved
			facilities to create full KiSS application systems with interactive user
			interfaces and persistent storage.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
                <font face="Arial">
				UltraKiss now supports interactive Labels, Buttons, Check Boxes, Radio Buttons,
				Text Boxes, Text Fields, multi-line scrollable Text Areas, scrollable Lists and
				Combo Boxes within KiSS sets.&nbsp;&nbsp; These basic Graphical User Interface
				(GUI) components are fully functional cels that provide simplified capability
				for user input and output.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific attributes can be defined for
				each GUI component to set characteristics such as text font types, size,
				component background and foreground colors, scrolling characteristics, and
				input capabilities.&nbsp; New FKiSS 5 UltraKiss commands are implemented to
				support setting and retrieving of component values.&nbsp; Component input
				events can be recognized with the standard FKiSS press() and release() event
				model.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				An example specification for a basic multi-line scrollable text area component
				within a KiSS object group is given below:<br>
				<br>
                #380.9999 12TA0S11-1.TextArea :
                18;%size[350,172]%offset[188,150]%attributes[fontstyle=bold,wrap,vsb,bc=14079694]<br>
					<br>
                This specification defines an input text area of a known size and
				position offset within object group #380.&nbsp; The text area performs word
				wrap, displays text in bold form, shows a vertical scroll bar, and has a
				specified background color.<br>
				<br>
				For further information on how to use the new KiSS GUI component features and				FKiSS 5 commands in UltraKiss, please see the UltraKiss Component
				documentation.<br>

				UltraKiss now provides new FKiSS 5 commands to				open(), read(),				write(), and close() external

				KiSS sets.&nbsp; For further information see the UltraKiss				FKiSS 5 command specifications.<br>

		  <li>
                <font face="Arial">
				New UltraKiss FKiSS 5 commands to access specific viewer services and retrieve
				information describing the viewer environment are now available.&nbsp; A new				viewer() command provides FKiSS capability to invoke print services,
				open new KiSS configurations, display KiSS files within a KiSS set, restart the
				active KiSS set, and so on.&nbsp; A new				environment() command can be used to retrieve current system
				information such as the system date and the registered user name.&nbsp; For
				further information see the UltraKiss FKiSS 5
				command specifications.</font></li>
