		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				We will create a brand new KiSS set that shows how to animate or move objects
				on the screen.&nbsp; Ensure that UltraKiss is showing the main logo
				screen.&nbsp; Close any existing data set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                                This tutorial requires <FONT color="#cc6600">image files</FONT>.  If the necessary files cannot be found 
                                on your computer download the tutorial files using <FONT color="#000099">Help-Tutorial Files</FONT>.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-New</FONT> .&nbsp; This will create a new KiSS
				set at size (448,320) with a black border and one empty page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Active Configuration</FONT> to edit the KiSS set
				configuration (CNF) file.&nbsp; In the [Screen Section] of the file change the
				screen size to <FONT color="#cc6600">(640,425)</FONT> and&nbsp; change the
				border colour to <FONT color="#cc6600">[4</FONT>.&nbsp; Exit the text editor
				and apply the changes.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT>.&nbsp; 
                                We are importing an image into a selection set rather than an object because more than one
                                image is going to be grouped together into one object. Select
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">eagle.cel</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Kisimi
				directory.&nbsp; When you import CEL images you may also have to identify a KiSS
				palette file to be used with the image.&nbsp; If prompted, choose the file <FONT color="#cc6600">
                                sdkismi.kcf</FONT> .&nbsp; The image will be loaded and positioned near the
				upper left corner of the playfield.&nbsp; Leave the image where it is.<br>
				<br>
				You will also see the background colour of the playfield change to a light
				brown.&nbsp; This occurs because we just added the first palette file,
				sdkismi.kcf, to the configuration.&nbsp; The playfield background colour is
				derived from this palette and in this case it is the first colour from the
				first palette.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT> and import the <FONT color="#cc6600">
					smoke1.cel</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Kisimi directory, and choose the <FONT color="#cc6600">
					sdkismi.kcf</FONT> palette.&nbsp; You will note that the smoke image is
				properly positioned behind the airplane.&nbsp; This is because both the eagle
				and the smoke cels have image offset values set in their image files.&nbsp;
                                These offset values are displacements from the origin.<br>
                                <br>
                                If you inadvertently import an image to an object instead of a selection then the image
                                will have a blue marque box around it.  To correct this you can unselect everything
                                (Edit-Unselect All) and then select all the required objects (Ctrl-right click and choose 
                                Select from the pop-up dialog), and then use Edit-Ungroup to convert all images to a selection set.  
                                Every image in a selection set should be drawn with a green marque box.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT> and import the <FONT color="#cc6600">
					smoke2.cel</FONT> file from Tutorial/Kisimi.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-New Group</FONT> to group the three image cels
				into one object group.&nbsp; A single blue selection box should now enclose the
                                complete object.<br>
                                <br>
                                An Edit-New Group puts all the images in the selection set into a new group object.
                                A new object number is assigned.  This is required if you had inadvertently imported
                                any of the smoke images to an object rather than the active selection set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Restart</FONT> to reload the data set.&nbsp;
				This will establish the new palette so that the border colours work
				properly.&nbsp; When the data set is reloaded you should see the border colour
				change from black to a dark peach colour.&nbsp; This is the fourth colour in
				the palette that we set in step 3.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Try to pick up the airplane and drag it.&nbsp; The airplane and the smoke
				should move as one object.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; Save the
				new KiSS set to the Tutorial/Kisimi directory or a directory of your
				choice.&nbsp; The configuration element name will be <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF1.cnf</FONT>
				if you began this tutorial after first starting UltraKiss.&nbsp; You can
				overwrite any existing element of the same name.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Close</FONT> to close the data set.&nbsp;
				UltraKiss will now show the main logo screen.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				To check your work use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT> to load the
				configuration file <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF1.cnf</FONT> from your directory.
