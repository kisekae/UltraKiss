		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Sometimes animation does not always require timer actions and alarm
				events.&nbsp; For simple animations we can use animated GIF files.&nbsp; These
				are image files that contain many frames that are automatically displayed in
				sequence.&nbsp; We will add an animated GIF file to our data set.&nbsp; Ensure
				that UltraKiss is showing the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing data
				set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT> to load the configuration file <FONT color="#cc6600">
					CNF3.cnf</FONT> from your directory.&nbsp; This will load the data set
				created in exercise 3 and you should see the airplane begin to move across the
				screen.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT>.&nbsp; Select
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">bunny.gif</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Kisimi
				directory.&nbsp; This is an animated gif file that contains 10 frames.&nbsp;
				The image will be loaded and positioned near the upper left corner of the
				playfield.&nbsp; Move the image to a suitable position in the bottom left part
				of the playfield.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				The bunny is walking.&nbsp; It would be useful to show some type of moving
				background that gives the perception of visible motion.&nbsp; Reload the data
				set with a <FONT color="#000099">View-Restart</FONT> command.&nbsp; This will
				commit your changes and set the initial position for the bunny.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT>.&nbsp; Select
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">hill2.gif</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Kisimi
				directory.&nbsp; This is a background image file.&nbsp; This image will be
				loaded and positioned at the upper left corner of the playfield.&nbsp; Leave it
				there.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT>.&nbsp; Select
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">hill3.gif</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Kisimi
				directory.&nbsp; This is another background image file that is paired with
				hill2.gif.&nbsp; These files have been constructed so that they partially
				overlap each other to give the impression of a continuous surface.&nbsp; This
				image will be loaded and positioned at the upper left corner of the
				playfield.&nbsp; Leave it there.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regroup</FONT> to consolidate the two background
				images into the same object group.&nbsp; The <FONT color="#cc6600">hill2.gif</FONT>
				image and <FONT color="#cc6600">hill3.gif</FONT> images should now be in object
				group #4 and you can check this by right clicking with the mouse while over the
				regrouped images.&nbsp; This will show a properties dialog for the new
				object.&nbsp;&nbsp; For any following FKiSS work, use your object group number
				as seen in this dialog.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Adjust Layering</FONT> to move the background
				images to the back of the scene.&nbsp; Select the <FONT color="#cc6600">hill2.gif</FONT>
				and <FONT color="#cc6600">hill3.gif</FONT> entries and drag them to the bottom
				of the list.&nbsp; Apply the changes.&nbsp; If the bunny and airplane cannot be
				seen after the changes are applied, click on the background to force a repaint
				of the screen.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Active Configuration</FONT> to open the text
				editor for the current configuration file.&nbsp; We need to add some FKiSS code
				to move our background images across the screen.&nbsp; We do this with a timer
				and alarm event.&nbsp; Add the following lines to the end of the configuration
				file:
				<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@alarm(4)<br>
					;@ move(#4,-1,0,"unconstrain") ; move scene to the left<br>
					;@ letobjectx(X,#4) ; get current location<br>
					;@ iflessthan(X,-640) ; finished first section?<br>
					;@ altmap(#4) ; yes, switch to next image<br>
					;@ moveto(#4,0,0) ; reset position<br>
					;@ endif()<br>
					;@ timer(4,50)<br>
				</font>
				<BR>
				<FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help
					documentation into your configuration file you must ensure that the semicolon
					and at-sign combination appears at the beginning of every line.<BR>
				</FONT>
				<br>
				This sets up an alarm event to shift the background one pixel to the left every
				50 milliseconds.&nbsp; The two images, hill2.gif and hill3.gif have been
				constructed to overlap each other for continuous looping.&nbsp; We swap between
				the two images half way through their movement using the altmap() action
				command.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				To start the activity add the following two lines at the end of the begin()
				event:<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@ unmap("hill3.gif") ; swap the background visibility<br>
					;@ timer(4,20) ; start the background moving<br>
				</font>&nbsp;
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use the <FONT color="#000099">File-Exit</FONT> command in the text editor to
				apply your changes.&nbsp; If you happened to have made a typing mistake you
				will see an error when the changes are applied.&nbsp; If this occurs, re-edit
				the configuration file to correct any mistakes.&nbsp; If there are no errors
				the data set should reload and open to page 0.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; Use a
				new <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF4.cnf</FONT> file name.&nbsp; This new
				configuration will contain the new event code.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				When you test your work you may see that the cursor shows as a hand pointer
				while over the background images, indicating that the object can be
				moved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The background should be fixed.&nbsp; To lock the background
				in place one or both of the image lines for hill2gif and hill3.gif in the Cel
				Section must be updated to set a fixed lock value for the image.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				<FONT color="#000099">Right click</FONT> while over the background and choose <FONT color="#000099">
					Image Context - Properties</FONT>.&nbsp; A properties dialog for the image
				will be shown.&nbsp; In the attributes section, press the little button beside
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">Lock Value</FONT> field.&nbsp; Enter 99999 for a new
				lock value and exit the dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will set a fix value for
				the image and its parent object.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Observe that the background is now fixed in place and can no longer be dragged
				with the mouse.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save</FONT> to save your work.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</li>
