		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				We are now going to edit the behavior of the simple calculator buttons we created in
				lesson 1.&nbsp; If you are continuing from lesson 1 you can skip to step
				3.&nbsp; Otherwise, ensure that UltraKiss is showing the main logo
				screen.&nbsp; Close any existing data set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT>&nbsp; to load the configuration file <FONT color="#cc6600">
					CNF1.cnf</FONT> from the Tutorial/FKiSS directory or the directory you used
				in lesson 1.&nbsp; This will load the button set that you created in lesson 1.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                Right-click on one of the calculator buttons. Select <font color="#000099">Image
                Context</font> from the pop-up menu and select the <font color="#000099">Event
                Wizard</font>. When the wizard dialog shows, choose a <font color="#CC6600"> press</font>
                event from the Event Type drop down combo box. You will see
                simple skeleton event code for a press event on the button cel generated for you.<br>
                <br>When digit buttons are pressed we need to update our
                calculator display. We need to know which numeral was pressed,
                but every button will behave in the same way.&nbsp; We will use
                a label module to centralize our display update logic.<br>
                <br>Replace the <font face="Courier New">;@notify(...)</font>
                statement in the generated skeleton code with the following
                line, using the correct digit value for the button that you are working
                with:<br>
                <br><font face="Courier New">;@ let(Digit,9) goto(DigitPressed)</font><br>
                <br>Repeat this step for all other digit buttons. Make sure that
                you use the correct numeral for the button that you are working
                with:<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                We will now code the DigitPressed label module. Use <font color="#000099">Tools-FKiSS
                Editor</font> to launch the FKiSS Editor tool. Choose <font color="#000099">File-New
                Event</font> to open a text editor window for the new event
                code. In the text editor, add the following code:<br>
                <br><font face="Courier New">;@label(DigitPressed)<br>
                ;@ mul(N,N,10) add(N,N,Digit) setText(&quot;textbox1.textbox&quot;,N)<br>
                <br>
                </font><FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help
					documentation into the text editor you must ensure that the semicolon
					and at-sign combination appears at the beginning of every line.&nbsp; You can
					copy the help text by selecting the text and pressing Ctrl-C to copy the text
					to the clipboard. Use Ctrl-V to paste the text into the configuration file.</FONT><BR>
                <br>The variable N represents our calculator number and the textbox is our display
                window. Each time we press a digit button the digit is appended
                to our calculator button.<br>
                <br>
                The setText(...) action command is a simple way to set the
                display field to the numeric value of the variable. Note that this
                is an UltraKiss specific command and the name
                &quot;textbox1.textbox&quot; must refer to the name of the
                textbox component added in the previous lesson.&nbsp; UltraKiss components
                simplifies the development of user interface code. With standard KiSS
                we would have to
                build many digit images to maintain a
                multi-digit display and this is far too complex for this
                tutorial.<br>
                <br>Exit the text editor and apply the changes to create the
                DigitPressed label event.<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                You should now see the new label event in the FKiSS Editor
                event list. We will now test our code. Press the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_03.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                pause breakpoint button on the FKiSS Editor toolbar or use <font color="#000099">Run-Program
                Pause</font>. This will
                temporarily hide the FKiSS Editor. It will return to show you
                the FKiSS code execution on the next event execution.<br>
                <br>The main UltraKiss window should now be visible. The FKiSS
                run indicator at the right end of the toolbar should now be
                yellow to show that a pause breakpoint is in effect. This
                indicator is green when FKiSS code is running normally,
                and red when stopped.<br>
                <br>On your main UltraKiss screen, press one of the calculator
                buttons. Observe that the FKiSS Editor immediately opens to the
                button event with
                the first action statement highlighted. The FKiSS Editor window title should begin with the word
                'Breakpoint'. This shows you that the editor is in breakpoint
                mode and is stepping through FKiSS code statements. The action statement <font face="Courier New">;@&nbsp;let(Digit,...)</font> should be highlighted.<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                In the FKiSS Editor, use <font color="#000099">Run-Execute
                Statement</font> or press F3 or click on the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_05.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                toolbar icon. This will execute the highlighted FKiSS action
                statement. Observe that the current value for the Digit variable
                shows up in the variable list in the left pane of the window.
                This variable list shows you current values for all your code
                variables.<br>
                <br>Continue to step through the code one statement at a time.
                Use <font color="#000099">Run-Execute Statement</font> or F3
                or press the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_05.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                toolbar icon.. Observe how the DigitPressed label routine is
                automatically entered through the goto() action. Also observe
                how the variable N is automatically created on first reference
                with an assumed initial value of 0.<br>
                <br>
                When you reach the last statement of the label event which is
                the setText() action command, you should see a popup dialog
                indicating that the breakpoint event has ended. The FKiSS Editor
                preview image pane should also have been updated with the new
                digit showing in the calculator textbox.&nbsp;<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                When the event has finished, press the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_04.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                toolbar button or use <font color="#000099">Run-Program Resume</font>
                to return to normal processing. This will hide the FKiSS Editor
                tool. With normal processing breakpoints are no longer pending.
                You can play with your set without invoking the FKiSS Editor.<br>
                <br>
                With the main UltraKiss window visible the FKiSS run indicator
                at the right end of the toolbar should be green. Test all your
                buttons and verify that the calculator display textbox
                accurately maintains the number as you enter different digits.<br>
                <br>
                You will eventually exceed the display limits as you keep
                appending digits to your number. You may also see incorrect
                values show up when the number is large. If this happens numeric overflow has occurred. To continue
                testing after overflow, use <font color="#000099">View-Restart</font>
                to reset the calculator. In lesson 3 we will add buttons to
                reset the calculator properly.<br>
                <br>
                If you do observe a fault, press the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_03.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                pause breakpoint button on the UltraKiss toolbar to activate the FKiSS Editor
                on the next event. Now, repeat the
                test that exhibited the fault and trace your FKiSS code
                execution to locate the problem.<br>
                <br>
                You will most likely find that you have a typing error or
                incorrect digit value specified for the button that you are
                pressing. If this is the case you will have to correct your
                FKiSS code. The following steps explain how to do this and are
                instructive to follow even if no errors exits.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                The
                FKiSS Editor can be used to change the values of variables as you
                step through your code. You can also edit your event logic to permanently
                correct any mistakes.<br>
                <br>
                Ensure that you are in normal processing mode and not
                currently debugging code in the FKiSS Editor. If you are
                currently breakpointed, press the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_04.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                toolbar button in the FKISS Editor or use <font color="#000099">Run-Program Resume</font>
                to return to normal processing. Then, within the main UltraKiss window, set a pause breakpoint on the next event by&nbsp; pressing the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_03.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                pause breakpoint button on the UltraKiss toolbar.<br>
                <br>
                Next, press one of your calculator buttons. This should
                automatically invoke the FKiSS Editor in breakpoint mode for a
                button press() event. The action statement <font face="Courier New">;@&nbsp;let(Digit,...)</font> should be highlighted.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                As we did in Step 6, in the FKiSS Editor use <font color="#000099">Run-Execute
                Statement</font> or press F3 or click on the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_05.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                toolbar icon. This will execute the highlighted FKiSS action
                statement. Observe that the current value for the Digit variable
                shows up in the variable list in the left pane of the window.<br>
                <br>
                We can change this variable value. Double-click the value field
                in the variable list table to select it. Then, type a new value for
                the variable, replacing its current value.<br>
                <br>
                Continue stepping through the code or press the <img border="0" src="../../fkisseditor/images/toolbar_07.gif" align="center" width="25" height="25">&nbsp;
                toolbar button to execute all code to the end of the event.
                Observe how the new variable value is used in all subsequent
                action commands. You can temporarily change any variable value in this way
                as you test your code. This is sometimes useful to confirm
                subsequent code correctness once you have located a problem and
                know how to fix it.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                When you want to edit your FKiSS code select an action
                statement or event statement in the FKiSS Editor event list and
                use <font color="#000099">File-Edit Event</font> to open a Text
                Editor tool for the selected event. Your event code will be
                displayed in the editor. Make your editing changes and exit the
                Text Editor to apply your changes.<br>
                <br>
                If you want to create new events, use <font color="#000099">File-New
                Event</font> as we did in Step 4. You can also create new events while editing any
                existing event, simply by writing new
                event declarations and code after the event being edited. When
                you exit the Text Editor the edited event code and all new
                events will be added to the KiSS set.<br>
                <br>
                Edited event code is always checked for valid syntax. If you
                make a typing mistake or some other problem exists with your
                code the syntax errors will be displayed and you will have an
                opportunity to re-edit the adjusted event code to correct your
                mistakes.<br>
                <br>
                If you choose to cancel the edit, no changes are made to the
                FKiSS code.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; Save the
				new KiSS set to the Tutorial/FKiSS directory or a directory of your
				choice.&nbsp; The configuration element name should be changed
                to <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF2.cnf</FONT>
				if you began this tutorial after first starting UltraKiss.&nbsp; You can
				overwrite any existing element of the same name.
