		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				This tutorial will show you how to bring new images into your KiSS set and work with images in an 
				existing KiSS set.  Images are the foundation of any KiSS application.  Kisekae UltraKiss is a 
				visual application development system.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                Ensure that UltraKiss is showing the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing set.
				In this lesson you will learn the difference between an image cel and an object group.  Cels are usually an image 
				but can be other things like buttons or text boxes or movies.  An object group is a collection of cels that together
				form a single object that can be manipulated as one unit.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                Ensure that UltraKiss is showing the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                This tutorial requires <FONT color="#cc6600">image files</FONT>.  If the necessary files cannot be found 
                on your computer download the tutorial files using <FONT color="#000099">Help-Tutorial Files</FONT>.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-New</FONT>.&nbsp; This will create a new KiSS
				set at size (800,600) with a black border and one empty page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Properties</FONT> to change the new KiSS
				configuration (CNF) file properties.&nbsp; The attributes section of the
				Properties dialog will show a playfield size of (800,600).&nbsp; Press the
				small button beside this attribute and change the screen size to <FONT color="#cc6600">
				(600,600)</FONT>.&nbsp; Exit the configuration Properties dialog by
				pressing the OK button.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				We are going to build a dynamic KiSS set that includes motion and animation. The first page of our set 
				will be a menu page.&nbsp;Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Add Component</FONT> and choose 
				a <FONT color="#cc6600">button</FONT> type component from the component selection dialog.  
				We will add two button components to this page.  We will also add two cel images to this page that 
				look like buttons to compare and contrast image cel type buttons with component type buttons.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				The button component will be labelled <FONT color="#cc6600">button1</FONT> and will be  
				positioned in the upper left corner of the playfield.
				It will have a green marquee box drawn around the image.  This green marquee box indicates that the
				button is a cel image selected for editing.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Drag the button to the center of the screen.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <li>
				Add another button.  Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Add Component</FONT> and choose a <FONT color="#cc6600">button</FONT> type
				component from the component selection dialog.   This button will be labelled <FONT color="#cc6600">button2</FONT>
				and will also have a green marquee box.  This button has been imported into the same selection set as the first button.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Drag this button to the center of the screen and position it below button 1.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>				
				Both buttons should have green marquee boxes. Both buttons are part of the same selection set. If they do not 
				both have green marquee boxes use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Undo All</FONT>
				and begin again from Step 4.  Note, if you start again your buttons will now be named <FONT color="#cc6600">button3</FONT>
				and <FONT color="#cc6600">button4</FONT> as new component names are created each time a Component is added.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Unselect All</FONT> or right-click any where on the screen not over
				an object.  The green marquee selection boxes will disappear as we are no longer selecting these
				cels for editing.  The two button components are now combined as part of the same object number #1.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<FONT color="#000099">Right-click</FONT> on one of the component button images and choose 
				<FONT color="#cc6600">Select</FONT> from the pop-up menu.
				The two buttons will now be encased in a blue marquee box.  The blue marquee box shows that this 
				object contains both buttons and has been selected for editing.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				When objects or cels are selected for editing they can always be moved on the screen or otherwise 
				manipulated regardless of any fix state or other restrictions that may apply within the KiSS set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>		
				Add another button.  Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Add Component</FONT> 
				and choose a <FONT color="#cc6600">button</FONT> type component from the component selection dialog.   
				This button will be labelled <FONT color="#cc6600">button3</FONT> and will also have a green marquee box.
				The blue marquee box around the first two buttons will disappear.  An object selection cannot be combined
				with an image selection.  When you created a new button you created a new cel image selection.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Drag this button to the center of the screen and position it below the other buttons.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>				
				The first two buttons belong to object group #1.  This third button, because it was not imported
				into an existing selection set, has created a new object in the configuration.  This would be object
				group #2.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<FONT color="#000099">Right-click</FONT> anywhere on the screen not on an object to remove any current edit selection.  
				Pick up the various button components with the mouse and move them on the screen.  Observe that one object has two button
				components that move together and the other object has only one.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				We can play with these object groups. Select the object group that has two button components by right-clicking
				on one of the buttons and choosing <FONT color="#cc6600">Select</FONT> from the pop-up menu.  Both buttons will
				now be encased with a blue marquee box.  This means that the object group is selected.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Now, select the object group that has only one button components by right-clicking
				on this button and choosing <FONT color="#cc6600">Select</FONT> from the pop-up menu.  
				This button will now be encased with a blue marquee box.  The other buttons will no longer be marked.  
				This selection of the single button object has changed our object selection set.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				To make multiple selections of objects use the <FONT color="#cc6600">CTRL</FONT> key.  Hold the CTRL key
				down and right click while over one of the unselected buttons in object #1.  Choose <FONT color="#cc6600">Select</FONT>
				from the pop-up menu.
				This object group will be selected and now all buttons will now show a blue marquee box.  Both object groups
				are now selected.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Even though the objects are both selected each object group will still move independently.  Use your mouse and move 
				each object.  To move all selected objects concurrently use the <FONT color="#cc6600">SHIFT</FONT> key.  Hold the SHIFT 
				key down and drag.  Observe the result.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Unselect All</FONT> or right-click somewhere on the screen not over an object
				to remove all selections.  Now, position your mouse near the upper left of the playfield and use your mouse 
				to draw a selection box around the buttons.  Hold the <FONT color="#cc6600">ALT</FONT> key key down as you drag 
				your mouse.	 Select all the buttons. This is another way to perform a multiple selection.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Both object groups are now selected but they are both independent objects as discussed in the previous step.  
				To combine these objects into one object group use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-New Group</FONT>.  This will create 
				a new group object with a new object number.  The marquee box will flash.  You can now pick up and move the new 
				object with your mouse.  All three buttons will move concurrently.					
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Active Configuration</FONT> or press <FONT color="#cc6600">F11</FONT>
				to open the Text Editor tool to view the CNF configuration element that has been created for this
				new KiSS set.  Editing this text document is another way to edit our configuration and update our KiSS set.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Select the first line in the <FONT color="#cc6600">[Cel Section]</FONT> of the file.
				This line should refer to object <FONT color="#cc6600">#3</FONT> and <FONT color="#cc6600">button6.button</FONT>.
				You will observe that various attributes are specified for this button after the last semicolon on the line.
				Another lesson will show how these attributes can be set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				You may observe that the component name for the third button has changed from <FONT color="#cc6600">button3.button</FONT> to 
				<FONT color="#cc6600">button6.button</FONT>.  This is a side effect of the Edit-New Group command.  Component names are
				internally generated when new components are created.  For now, select the line containing this component name and 
				press the <FONT color="#cc6600">Del</FONT> key on your keyboard to delete this line.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Use the <FONT color="#000099">File-Exit</FONT> command to exit the text editor and apply the changes to the active set.
				The set will reload and the third button you created in Step 7 will be gone.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				We will now add two cel images that look like buttons to this page. 
				On the main UltraKiss screen use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New
				Object</FONT>.&nbsp; Select the <FONT color="#cc6600">button1.cel</FONT> file
				from the Tutorial/Visual Editing directory.&nbsp; This is a truecolor or Cherry Kiss cel
				so you will not see a prompt for an associated palette file.&nbsp; The
				image will be loaded as a new object and positioned at the upper left corner of the playfield.
				It will have a blue marquee box as it was imported as an object.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Drag the button to the center of the screen and position it beside the other button components.&nbsp; 
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>	
				Now, use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT> to import another image as a cel.&nbsp; 
				You may find that you cannot use the Import to Selection command as it is disabled.  The previous selection 
				imported an image as an object and it has a blue marquee box.  Object selection sets cannot be combined with
				image selection sets.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>				
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Unselect All</FONT> or right-click somewhere on the screen not over an object
				to remove all selections.  Now, repeat the command to <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT>.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>								
				Select the <FONT color="#cc6600">button2.cel</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Visual Editing directory.&nbsp; This is another 
				truecolor or Cherry Kiss cel so you will not see a prompt for an associated palette file.  This image cel as
				it has been imported as a selection will be encased in a green marquee box.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>											
				Position the second button below the first button.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                Note the difference between <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT>
                and <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT>.  The first command imports
                images into the KiSS set that are intended to be grouped together into the same object.
                These images all have green marquee boxes.  They are put together into one object with
                a new object number using the <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regroup</FONT> command.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                The <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT> is used when the image
                is intended to be placed into its own object.  These images all have blue marquee boxes.
                New unique object numbers are assigned to these images when they are imported.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				We will now explore selecting cels. Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Unselect All</FONT> or right-click somewhere 
				on the screen not over an object to remove all selections.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Select only the two image cels recently imported with the <FONT color="#cc6600">Press Me</FONT> text.  Select the objects by right clicking and choosing 
				<FONT color="#000099">Select</FONT> while holding the <FONT color="#cc6600">CTRL</FONT> key down.  
				You can also select multiple objects with the mouse by holding the <FONT color="#cc6600">ALT</FONT> key down 
				and drawing a selection box.  Draw a box only around the two image cels recently imported.
				The objects when selected will both have blue marquee boxes.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                When the objects are selected use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Ungroup</FONT> to draw green marquee boxes
                around all image cels in all the objects.  When images are all individually selected an <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regoup</FONT>
				will restore the selected image cels back into their original object.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Although we have two images selected with green marquee boxes they are not part of the same object.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                For example, with the objects both ungrouped and showing green marquee boxes for the cels, use your mouse and drag 
				one of the cels off to the side.  Perform an <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regroup</FONT> and observe that the two cels
				are restored as individual objects in their new position.  Both buttons should now have blue marquee boxes.  Further,
				if you pick up and drag these two button cels with your mouse both cels move independently.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>				
				Ungrouping and regrouping cels in this way lets us manipulate object cels within the object.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>	
				When the images are all ungrouped an <FONT color="#000099">Edit-New Group</FONT> will combine all selected image cels into one 
				new object. A new object number is assigned.  Combining cels in this way is identical to combining group objects as we did previously 
				with the component buttons.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				With both button cels with the <FONT color="#cc6600">Press Me</FONT> descriptions selected as objects with blue marquee boxes, 
				use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Ungroup</FONT> once again to draw green marquee boxes around the objects.  This time use 
				<FONT color="#000099">Edit-New Group</FONT>	to combine the cels into one object.  The blue marquee box will now show the boundary 
				of the combined cels.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>	
				Once again use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Ungroup</FONT> to convert the object to selected cels or right-click on one
				of the selected buttons and choose <FONT color="#cc6600"Ungroup</FONT> from the pop-up menu.  This time right click on the  
				cel image that you dragged to the side in the previous step and choose <FONT color="#cc6600">Select Cel</FONT> from the pop-up menu.  
				A yellow marquee box will be drawn around this cel image.  A yellow marquee box indicates that this is a selected cel from within 
				the set of cels selected in the object.  Selected cels like this are used for copy and paste operations that will be explored in 
				the following lesson.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>					
				Use your mouse to drag this selected cel and position it so that one button is better aligned above the other button.  
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regroup</FONT> to restore the object group with the repositioned cel.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; Save the
				new KiSS set to the Tutorial/Visual Editing directory or a directory of your
				choice.&nbsp; The configuration element name should be <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF1.cnf</FONT>
				if you began this tutorial after first starting UltraKiss.&nbsp; You can
				overwrite any existing element of the same name.
