		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				This tutorial will show you how to bring new images into your KiSS set.&nbsp; New images are the foundation 
                                of any Kisekae application.  Kisekae UltraKiss is a visual development system.<br>
                                <br>
                                Ensure that UltraKiss is showing the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                                This tutorial requires <FONT color="#cc6600">image files</FONT>.  If the necessary files cannot be found 
                                on your computer download the tutorial files using <FONT color="#000099">Help-Tutorial Files</FONT>.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-New</FONT>.&nbsp; This will create a new KiSS
				set at size (800,600) with a black border and one empty page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Properties</FONT> to change the new KiSS
				configuration (CNF) file properties.&nbsp; The attributes section of the
				Properties dialog will show a playfield size of (800,600).&nbsp; If it is
                                not showing that size, press the
				small button beside this attribute and change the screen size to <FONT color="#cc6600">
					(800,600)</FONT>.&nbsp; Exit the configuration Properties dialog by
				pressing the OK button.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				The first page of our set will be a menu page.&nbsp; We will add two cel images
                                that look like buttons to this page.  We will use these buttons to switch to other pages in the set.&nbsp; 
                                Each button will have a 'press' event attached to it.&nbsp; The 'press' event will have the FKiSS code
				that we use to switch to a new page.<BR>
				<BR>
				On the main UltraKiss screen use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New
					Object</FONT>.&nbsp; Select the <FONT color="#cc6600">button1.cel</FONT> file
				from the Tutorial/FKiSS directory.&nbsp; This is a truecolor or Cherry Kiss cel
				so you will not see a prompt&nbsp;for an associated palette file.&nbsp; The
				image will be loaded and positioned at the upper left corner of the playfield.<BR>
				<BR>
				Drag the button to the center of the screen.&nbsp; <FONT color="#cc6600">Repeat
					this step to import button2.cel</FONT>.&nbsp; Position the second button
				below the first button.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
                                Note the difference between <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to Selection</FONT>
                                and <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT>.  The first command imports
                                images into the KiSS set that are intended to be grouped together into the same object.
                                These images all have green marquee boxes.  They are put together into one object with
                                a new object number using the <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regroup</FONT> command.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                Images like the chest plate and the underwear that have front and back parts are imported 
                                as selections as these images are intended to be grouped together into one object.<BR>
				<BR>
                                The <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT> is used when the image
                                is intended to be placed into its own object.  These images all have blue marquee boxes.
                                New unique object numbers are assigned to these images when they are imported.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                It is not necessarily a problem if you imported images as objects and later decide
                                you wanted them as image selections.<br>
                                <br>
                                To combine two or more objects into one new object, select the objects by right clicking
                                and choosing <FONT color="#000099">Select</FONT> while holding the <FONT color="#cc6600">CTRL</FONT> 
                                key down.  The CTRL key is used for multiple selections.  You can also select multiple
                                objects with the mouse by holding the <FONT color="#cc6600">ALT</FONT> key down and drawing
                                a selection box.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                When objects are selected use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Ungroup</FONT> to draw green marquee boxes
                                around all image cels in the objects.  When the images are all individually selected
                                an <FONT color="#000099">Edit-New Group</FONT> will combine all selected image cels into a new
                                object.  A new object number is assigned.

		  <li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; Save the
				new KiSS set to the Tutorial/FKiSS directory or a directory of your
				choice.&nbsp; The configuration element name should be <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF1.cnf</FONT>
				if you began this tutorial after first starting UltraKiss.&nbsp; You can
				overwrite any existing element of the same name.
