			<li>
				If you tested the events from exercise 4 you should notice that when switching
				back and forth from page 0 to page 1, sometimes the sailor costume is not
				visible.&nbsp; This is because our event logic is not complete.&nbsp; If you
				are continuing on from lesson 4 you can skip to step 3.&nbsp; Otherwise, ensure
				that UltraKiss is showing the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing data
				set.
If you want to ensure that your new KiSS set is created to be compatible with other viewers, press one of the viewer compatibility preset buttons on the toolbar.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT> command to load the configuration
				file <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF4.cnf</FONT> from the Tutorial/Sailor Moon
				directory or the directory you used in lesson 4.&nbsp; This will load the
				Sailor Moon KiSS set created in exercise 4.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				For our set(1) event we quite properly made the sailor costume invisible but we
				forgot to make the school uniform visible.&nbsp; Our set(1) event is not
				complete.&nbsp; This time we will use the FKiSS Editor to edit our event. Use <FONT color="#000099">Tool-FKiSS Editor </FONT> to
				open the editor.&nbsp; Select the
				set(1) event in the tree and use <FONT color="#000099">File-Edit Event</FONT> to open a text editor.&nbsp; Change the complete set(1) event code to be as
				follows, using the correct object numbers from your data set:<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@set(1)<br>
					;@ unmap(#4) unmap(#5) unmap(#6) unmap(#7) unmap(#8)<br>
					;@ map(#10) map(#11) map(#12) map(#13) </font>
				<p><FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help
						documentation into your configuration file you must ensure that the semicolon
						and at-sign combination appears <u>at the beginning of every line</u>.&nbsp; You can
						copy the FKiSS text by selecting the text and pressing Ctrl-C to copy the text
						to the clipboard, and Ctrl-V to paste the text into the text editor.<br>
				</FONT><BR>
				Exit the text editor to apply your changes.<br>
			  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
	  Similarly, we should write a set(0) event to ensure that the sailor costume is
	  visible whenever page 0 is shown.&nbsp; We don't need to worry about the school
				uniform on page 0 as these objects do not apply to this page.&nbsp; In the FKiSS Editor, use <FONT color="#000099">File-New Event</FONT>. This will open a text editor that is initially empty. Code a
				set(0) event as shown, using the object numbers from your data set:<br>
	  <br>
	  <font face="Courier New">;@set(0)<br>
		  ;@ map(#4) map(#5) map(#6) map(#7) map(#8) </font>
	  <p><FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help documentation into your
	  configuration file you must ensure that the semicolon and at-sign combination appears <u>at the beginning of every line</u>.&nbsp;
	  You can copy the help text by selecting the text and pressing Ctrl-C to copy the text to the clipboard, and Ctrl-V to paste
	  the text into the text editor.</FONT><br>
	  </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Exit the FKiSS Editor with <FONT color="#000099">File-Exit</FONT>,
				or if you want to leave the FKiSS Editor active for future changes you can resume your set execution with <FONT color="#000099">Run-Program Resume</FONT> or pressing the green dot on the toolbar.&nbsp;
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Test your changes.&nbsp; Switch back and forth from page 0 to page 1 and
				observe that the sailor costume shows properly.&nbsp; If there is a problem use <FONT color="#000099">
					View-Active Configuration</FONT> and verify that all set(0) and set(1)
				event logic is correct and references the actual object numbers in your
				configuration.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				You may also have noticed that the doll body is not permanently fixed in
				place.&nbsp; If you try, you can pick up and move the doll from underneath the
				clothes.&nbsp; This is usually not desired.&nbsp; We fix this as follows.<br>
				<br>
				Place the mouse over any part of the doll not covered by clothing, such as the
				face or arms or legs.&nbsp; Right click with the mouse and a popup menu for the
				doll object will appear.&nbsp; Select <FONT color="#000099">Image Context -
					Properties</FONT>.&nbsp; A dialog window for the doll image will be
				shown.&nbsp; A picture of the doll will be in the preview area of this dialog
				window.<br>
				<br>
				Press the small button beside the <FONT color="#000099">Lock Value</FONT> setting
				in the attributes section.&nbsp; Enter the value 99999.&nbsp; Press the OK
				button to close the Properties dialog and then observe that the doll image can
				no longer be picked up and moved with the mouse.&nbsp; The lock value has fixed
				the doll in place because the value 99999 exceeds the value set for a maximum
				fixed object.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
			  We can have fun with lock values.&nbsp; For example, place the mouse over the
				school uniform skirt or fuku and right click.&nbsp; Select <FONT color="#000099">
                                Image Context-Properties</FONT> and change the skirt lock value to
				5.&nbsp; This will make the skirt 'sticky', or slightly difficult to remove
				from the doll.&nbsp; After closing the Properties dialog window try to move the
                                skirt and observe the result.<br>
                                <br>
                                You should see the skirt move slightly and then snap back to its initial place.
                                This is called a sticky object because it cannot be easily moved.  If you keep
                                trying to move the skirt eventually it will break free.  At this time you are
                                allowed to move the skirt anywhere.  The skirt broke free on the fifth attempt
                                because the lock value had been set to 5.<br>
                                <br>
                                You can restore the object sticky behaviour if you <FONT color="#000099">View-Reset</FONT> the page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; The
				corrected event code will replace the <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF4.cnf</FONT> file
				previously loaded and the new object lock values will be saved in the
				configuration file.<br>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
