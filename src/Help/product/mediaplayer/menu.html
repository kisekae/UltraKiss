<h1><font color="#FF0000">Media Player Menu Commands</font></h1>
<hr>

<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to the Kisekae Media Player program documentation. The Media Player menu provides a
standard drop down list of commands for all media player functions.&nbsp;</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 align="left"> <font color="#000080" face="Arial"> File Menu</font></h2>
<font face="Arial">
The File menu has commands to load and save media files and playlist files.&nbsp; The Kisekae
Media Player can load any supported media file format as discussed in the Media
Player <a href="index.html#Introduction">Introduction</a>.</font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileOpen"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Open...</font></a></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The Open command is used to open an existing KiSS media file or any other
type of media file recognized by the Kisekae
UltraKiss program.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 1 shows a standard Microsoft Windows file Open dialog.&nbsp;
The file Open dialog can be used to select any file.&nbsp; If the selected file is of
an audio or video type recognized by the Kisekae program then the media file will be
opened.&nbsp;
If the file is a text playlist file with an LST extension it will also be
opened.&nbsp;
If the file is not of a type recognized by the program then an error message
will be displayed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The example in Figure 1 selected the archive file TESTSETC.LZH.&nbsp; When
opening archive files, the Media Player will display a selection list of
suitable media elements found within the archive.&nbsp;These elements can be
audio or video files or playlist files.&nbsp; Figure 2 shows a media selection dialog for the
TESTSETC.LZH file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileClose"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Close</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Close command is used to close the currently active media file or
playlist file.&nbsp;If a
playlist has been updated or
modified the user will be prompted to save the current file.&nbsp; Figure 4
is an example of a close prompt dialog.&nbsp; Canceling the file save will cancel the
close request.&nbsp; If a playlist file is to be saved&nbsp; the <a href="#FileSaveAs">File-Save As</a> command
is invoked.&nbsp; If not, the close operation will continue and all changes are
lost.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 4. Close Prompt Dialog</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Files loaded from a compressed archive are written to the original archive
file from which they were loaded.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileSave"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save command saves playlist elements.&nbsp; KiSS playlist files are, by default, saved to the file directory or compressed archive file
from which they were loaded.&nbsp; For example, if a media file was loaded from
an archive file then any updated playlist will be written back to this archive
file.&nbsp; If the files were loaded from a file
directory then the Save operation writes any updated playlist into this
directory.&nbsp; When files are saved to a compressed archive then the complete archive file
is rewritten, replacing all updated elements in the archive.&nbsp; For files loaded from a directory only the
playlist file is written.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save operation is performed in the background.&nbsp; Figure 5 shows the file save window that
tracks the progress of the file output.&nbsp; The save operation may be
cancelled at any time.&nbsp; If an error occurs an appropriate
message will be displayed and the save operation will be cancelled.&nbsp; If the
save operation is successful the dialog window will be automatically closed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img border="0" src="images/menu_05.gif" width="400" height="200"></font></p>
<p align="center"> <font face="Arial"> Figure 5. File Save Window</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that files are written to temporary files on disk and then renamed to the permanent
file name if the save operation is successful.&nbsp; This ensures that backup
file copies exist in the event of a program error.&nbsp; The backup file is
normally deleted upon completion of a successful save. Backups can be retained
permanently if the UltraKiss <a href="../kisekae/options.html#KeepFileBackup">Keep File Backup</a> program option has been set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="FileSaveAs"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Save As...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save As operation provides a means to save the currently loaded playlist to a new file.&nbsp; If the
playlist or media file was loaded from a compressed
archive file then the Save As function will write the playlist&nbsp; to a new
element in the compressed archive
file.&nbsp; If the file was loaded from a file
directory then the Save As function will write the element with a new name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 6 shows a standard Microsoft Windows file Save
As dialog.  The Media Player Save As dialog will only accept element file names.&nbsp;
You cannot change the name of the archive file from which the playlist element
was loaded.&nbsp; To change archive file names, use the <a href="../archivemanager/index.html"> Archive Manager</a> tool.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Save operation proceeds as described in the <a href="#FileSave">File-Save</a>
command.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileQueue"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Queue...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Queue command initiates a <a href="#FileOpen">File-Open</a>
command.&nbsp; The selected file is added to any active playlist currently in
use.&nbsp; If the Media Player is inactive, queuing a file creates a new
playlist as shown in Figure 3b and the queued media file begins to play.&nbsp;
If the Media Player is active, queuing a new file will create a new playlist if
required and add the file to the end of the list.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Media files are played in sequence.&nbsp; When a media file reaches the end
of media the next file will start.&nbsp; When the last playlist media file
completes the Media Player will enter an inactive state.&nbsp; The playlist will
repeat from the first file if the player <a href="#OptionsLoopPlayback">Loop
Playback</a> option is set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The UltraKiss Media Player requires that all media files in a playlist be
loaded from the same file directory or compressed archive file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="FileDelete"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Delete...</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The Delete command is used to remove queued entries from an active playlist
file.&nbsp; When a playlist as seen in Figure 3b is loaded, the highlighted or
selected file can be deleted from the list.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the selected file is currently playing it will be closed, the playlist
entry will be deleted, and the next playlist entry will start.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a name="FileExit"><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Exit</font></a></h3>



<p><font face="Arial">The Exit command closes any currently media file and terminates the Media
Player program execution.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">If a playlist file in the Media Player has been updated or
modified the user will be prompted to save the current playlist.&nbsp; Figure 4
is an example of a close prompt dialog.&nbsp; Cancelling the save will cancel the
exit request.&nbsp; If the current file is saved&nbsp; then the <a href="#FileSaveAs">File-Save As</a> command
is invoked and the Media Player program terminates upon completion of the save.&nbsp; If
changes are not saved they will be
lost.&nbsp;</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">If the Media Player program is terminated by closing the window the
Exit command will be automatically invoked.&nbsp; The option
to cancel the Exit request will not be available.</font></p>
