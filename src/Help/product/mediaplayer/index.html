<h2><b><a name="Introduction"><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></a></b></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Media Player is a full featured audio and visual playback program designed to reproduce media
files contained within KiSS data sets.  This online Help document provides reference material for the various
commands and options available within the Media Player program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Media Player is an independent application that is designed for playback
of background music during your UltraKiss session.&nbsp; You start the
Media Player with the UltraKiss <a href="../kisekae/menu.html#ToolsMediaPlayer">Tools-Media
Player</a> command.&nbsp; This will open the main Media Player screen.&nbsp; You
use menu commands to load audio files or movie files or playlist files as
required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A playlist is a text document that lists media file names that are to be
played in sequence.&nbsp; The Media Player will load a playlist file with a LST
file extension and play each file.&nbsp; The Media Player provides menu commands
to queue or delete entries from the playlist and to save playlists as
required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Media Player can be integrated within your KiSS data set.&nbsp; The <a href="../reference/fkiss5.html#mediaplayer">mediaplayer()</a>
FKiSS action command will start the Media Player application and initiate
playback of the specified media file or playlist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Media Players
started in this way are associated with the active KiSS data set and will be
terminated when the data set is closed.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Media Player uses Java Media Framework (JMF) to play media files.&nbsp;
Kisekae UltraKiss can be used with any version of JMF.&nbsp; Note
that cross-platform version of JMF only supports the following audio sample
rates: 8, 11.025, 11.127, 16, 22.05, 22.254, 32, 44.1, and 48 KHz.</font></p>

is first launched.&nbsp; The menu bar at the top of the screen provides commands

If an audio file is loaded the Media Player will display an active audio control
screen as shown in Figure 2a or Figure 2b.&nbsp; The window title will show the

<p><font face="Arial">If a playlist is loaded the Media Player will show, in a scrollable list, all
media files queued for playback.&nbsp; Figure 4 is an example of a playlist.&nbsp; The highlighted list entry shows the currently active media
file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any entry in the playlist can be selected for playback by
clicking on the line item.&nbsp; The playlist can be edited by inserting new
entries with the Insert key or the <a href="menu.html#FileQueue"> File-Queue</a> command, or deleted using the
Delete key or the <a href="menu.html#FileDelete"> File-Delete</a> command.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Arial">Playlists are useful for playback of a collection of audio files.&nbsp; A
movie file or mixed file collection is possible, too.&nbsp; If movie files are
active the Media Player will show the movie and the playlist will not be seen
until the movie ends.</font>
