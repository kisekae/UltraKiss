		<p><font face="Arial">Kisekae UltraKiss is distributed as open source software from <a href="http://www.bronzeart.ca/ultrakiss">
				Bronze Art by William Miles</a> and from SourceForge under the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kisekae-ultrakiss/">Kisekae UltraKiss</a> project.&nbsp; The UltraKiss product has been developed as a
			platform independent product for Microsoft, Unix and Apple computer
			systems.&nbsp; UltraKiss is distributed with a stand-alone Jave run time environment (JRE) as a bundled product.  However, if other versions are desired Java software may also be downloaded from <a href="https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads">Open Logic</a>.</font>

		<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>For all systems, download ultrakiss_3.4.zip from <a href="http://www.bronzeart.ca/ultrakiss">Bronze Art by William Miles</a> . Extract the files.</p>

<p>For local execution on a Windows system with or without Java installed, run UltraKiss_3.4.exe found in the ultrakiss folder.</p>

<p>For local execution on a Linux or Apple system with Java already installed, run the kisekae.jar file from the ultrakiss folder using the java -jar kisekae.jar command.</p>

<p>On all systems, you must run the UltraKiss program from within the ultrakiss folder. This is required for the sound and help libraries to be found. This folder also contains a standalone version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for systems that do not have Java installed.</p>

<p>If the .jar extension is configured in your system as a Java application then you can run the program by directly clicking on this file.</p>

<p>The source code for this project is available on SourceForge under project Kisekae UltraKiss. If you are interested in contributing to this project please contact me.</p>

		<p>UltraKiss Version 3.3b and later is required to access my historical Kisekae Sets library available on my website.  To load and run these KiSS sets from my website use the File-Portal menu command within UltraKiss.</p>
