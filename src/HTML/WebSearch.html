<p align="left"><b>Step 1</b>.  Given a top level URL to a website or a file
directory, the reference page is examined to identify all hyperlinks to archive
files. To ensure that all archive files are located within the site hierarchy,
every HTML page in a web site and every subdirectory in a top-level directory is
scanned.  This search is a breadth first top down recursive scan of the complete
target system. The scan terminates when all links in the site hierarchy have been
processed.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2</b>. Every archive file identified in Step 1 is loaded in
UltraKiss. The file load is a batch process and requires no user interaction.  If the file loads successfully
then this validates the file as a KiSS archive.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3</b>. If an archive file is validated as a KiSS set then a thumbnail image
can be produced from the UltraKiss screen image.  The set can also be saved to local file
storage or retained as a remote hyperlink depending on the specified Search
options. Set statistics are also
identified.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4</b>. When all sets are validated an HTML index into the directory or
web site is constructed.  This is a table of all validated sets, sorted by name,
with thumbnail images and hyperlinks to the actual KiSS archive files. The
hyperlinks can
be links to remote URLs on a web site or to locally stored files. This
dynamically built HTML index
file is written to the directory specified in the Search options and named according
to the site URL or top level directory originally specified in Step 1.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5</b>. The new HTML index is now added to the primary master index maintained
for all scanned hosts.  Each primary site or top level directory becomes one line item in the
master search index. Thus, each time you scan a new web site that contains KiSS
files, a new entry for that web site is created. Once built, the master index
can be directly accessed using the menu and toolbar of the UltraKiss Portal. </p>
