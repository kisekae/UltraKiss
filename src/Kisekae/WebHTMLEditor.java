* WebHTMLEditor class

*
* This class extends the HTMLEditorKit to define a minimum synchronous load
* priority for image load threads.  HTML pages that contain many images can
* impact performance during loading.

/*
   The JEditorPane.setPage() does an asynchronous loading of HTML
   data. If you try to iterate on the doc before the parsing is
   completed you only get the tags for the empty doc.
   You can force a syncrhonous loading by deriving a class from
   HTMLEditorKit as follow:

   public class SyncHTMLEditor extends HTMLEditorKit {
   public Document createDefaultDocument() {
   AbstractDocument doc=(AbstractDocument)
   super.createDefaultDocument();
   doc.setAsynchronousLoadPriority(-1);
   }
   }

   and use is in JEditorPane:

   //JEditorPane jpane
   ...
   jpane.setEditorKit(new SyncHTMLEditor());
   ...
   jpane.setPage("http://java.sun.com/");
   */

   {
      HTMLDocument doc = (HTMLDocument) super.createDefaultDocument() ;
      int priority = Thread.NORM_PRIORITY ;
      doc.setAsynchronousLoadPriority(priority) ;
      doc.setTokenThreshold(1000) ;
      doc.putProperty("imageCache",imagecache);
//      doc.setAsynchronousLoadPriority(-1);
      return doc ;
