/**
* AlarmDeclarationOrder class
*
* Purpose:
*
* This class compares Alarm objects to determine their declaration order
* in the CNF.  Apparently PlayFKiSS fires identical time alarms in this
* order, probably because it scanned the alarm list to find alarms that
* needed to be fired.
*
* This comparator is used by FKissEvent to properly sequence event initiated
* alarms before they are put on the AlarmTimer queue.
*
