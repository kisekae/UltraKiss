		<h2 align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">System Requirements</font></h2>
		<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kisekae UltraKiss requires a Java capable system.&nbsp; UltraKiss will run on all supported Java levels beginning from Java version 1.3. 
		A multi-platform product release is offered for Windows, Unix, and Apple systems with a supplied Java release 8 Run Time Environment. </font>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Windows systems require a 450 Mhz processor and 256 megabytes of memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></p>
		<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Apple systems require Mac OS X with a minimum 700 Mhz processor and 256 megabytes of memory</strong></font></p>
		<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Linux systems require an Intel Pentium platforms running the Linux kernel v2.2.12 or later.</strong></font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Effective with release version 2.0, Kisekae UltraKiss is open source software released under terms of the GNU General Public License. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<H2><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial">Apple Systems</font></H2>
		<p>UltraKiss works best with a 2-button mouse for edit selection.&nbsp; Ensure
        that your right mouse button is configured on Apple systems as the
        Secondary mouse button. If a 2 button mouse is not available then secondary mouse clicks require the Command key to be pressed.</p>
		<p>UltraKiss also uses Function Keys F9-F12 to accelerate some menu
        items. For Apple systems these are replaced with Shift-F9 through
        Shift-F12.</p>
        <p>The Apple Option key is used in all cases where the documentation
        specifies an Alt key.</p>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<H2><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial">Linux Systems</font></H2>
		<p>Linux systems should disable the Alt key edit
        selection option as this key may be intercepted by the Operating System
        for window movement.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Edit functions on Linux systems are performed with the Shift key. </p>
