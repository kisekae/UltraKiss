          Secure sets cannot be edited in UltraKiss and the CNF information cannot be 
		directly viewed.&nbsp; This means  that within UltraKiss, secure sets cannot be examined. However, other viewers or tools may still have access to your set information. Therefore, on a future release the LZH file may be&nbsp;encrypted 
			to further&nbsp;protect your work from tools external to UltraKiss.<BR>
	      <BR>
		  You must save your set to implement this feature as a set specific option.</font></P>
