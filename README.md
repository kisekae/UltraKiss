# UltraKiss
In 2002 I developed a computer program that implements the Kisekae Set system, KiSS, a Japanese graphics system originally 
developed to facilitate costume changes on virtual dolls.  

Kisekae is short for "kisekae ningyou", a Japanese term meaning "dress-up dolls". Unlike "computer art" which creates or 
displays traditional art via a computer, KiSS uses the computer as the medium, allowing the art to be not only animated, 
but also interactive. Marshall McLuhan in his treatise "The Medium is the Message" discovered that the forms and methods 
used to communicate information have a significant impact on the messages they deliver.

KiSS is a presentation method that allows the artist to program certain actions as you interact with a doll.  
Kisekae UltraKiss is a full featured integrated development environment for creating, editing and displaying KiSS sets. 

UltraKiss extends the KiSS medium to visual artistic programming. The Kisekae Set system is no longer restricted to dress-up 
dolls but is now a development system to create visual applications.  This is an artistic process for computing that uses 
illustrations and visual elements. It allows the artist to think in terms of visual objects and actions rather than 
text-based code.

UltraKiss was developed to help artists build their KiSS sets. UltraKiss reads and interprets KiSS data files.  
These files contain computer graphics images, color palettes and data control files.  Objects, such as the doll figure, 
costumes, and other items are constructed from layered image components that usually show only parts of the complete image. 

Objects could be manipulated through user actions or through  a simple event processing model that enables timed animations 
or other actions if objects are touched or dragged across the screen.  Color variations, enabled through palette changes in 
UltraKiss, could also be used to produce different results.  

In 2008 I ceased this work. Computers were faster and the KiSS model was replaced with different animation tools.

In 2018 I removed this application from my websites. Later, I had a request to restore the application.

In 2023, prompted by new KiSS work from The Owl with his Scarecrow sets, I completed my work.  I am releasing my
source code under a GNU version 3 license in the hopes that it is useful and brings enjoyment to others.  I am seeking 
contributers and another sponser to take over this work.
