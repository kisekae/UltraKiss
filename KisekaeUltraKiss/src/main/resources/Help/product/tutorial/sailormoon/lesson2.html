		<ol>
			<li>
				We will now add the remaining sailor costume images to the <FONT color="#000099">Sailor
				Moon</FONT> data set.&nbsp; If you are continuing from lesson 1 you can
				skip to step 3.&nbsp; Otherwise, ensure that UltraKiss is showing the main logo
				screen.&nbsp; Close any existing data set. If you want to ensure that your new KiSS set is created
				to be compatible with other viewers, press one of the viewer compatibility preset buttons on the toolbar
				<img src="images/playfkiss.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="5" align="absmiddle">
				<img src="images/directkiss.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="5" align="absmiddle">
				<img src="images/gnomekiss.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="5" align="absmiddle">
				or use <FONT color="#000099">Tools-Options-Compatibility</FONT> to set a compatibility preset.
				This lesson requires editing of the KiSS set so ensure that the Edit Enable toggle button
				on the toolbar is set.<img src="images/editenable.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="5" align="absmiddle">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT>&nbsp; to load the configuration file
				<FONT color="#cc6600">CNF1.cnf</FONT> from the Tutorial/Sailor Moon directory or the directory
				you used in lesson 1.&nbsp; This will load the Sailor Moon KiSS set that you
				created in lesson 1.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT>.&nbsp; Select
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">fuku.gif</FONT> file from the Tutorial/Sailor Moon
				directory.&nbsp; The image will be loaded and positioned at the upper left
				corner of the playfield. If any viewer preset compatibility option is set the image 
                                will be converted to a CEL file with an appropriate KCF. This conversion is performed 
                                if the <FONT color="#000099">Options-Options-Import</FONT> setting is set to 
                                <FONT color="#000099">Import all images as CEL files</FONT>.  The image 
                                when imported will also have a blue selection marquee box drawn around the image.  
                                This box shows that the image has been selected for editing.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Drag the image and position it on the doll.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New Object</FONT> and import the
				images <FONT color="#cc6600">leftglove.gif</FONT>, <FONT color="#cc6600">rightglove,gif</FONT>,
				and <FONT color="#cc6600">bow.gif</FONT>.&nbsp; You can import these images all
				at once if you hold the <FONT color="#cc6600">ctrl key</FONT> down and make
				multiple selections.&nbsp; Position these objects appropriately on the doll.
 				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>You can use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Unselect All</FONT> to remove the selection boxes
				from the images and terminate your editing.&nbsp; Or, simply <FONT color="#cc6600">right-click</FONT>
				with your mouse pointer while it is not over an object to unselect all objects.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Restart</FONT> or press F8 to reload the set in UltraKiss and commit
				your changes.&nbsp; Or, you can use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Write Page</FONT> to set the initial
				positions for the new imported objects after you have moved them to their final location.&nbsp; Once
				the initial positions are set a <FONT color="#000099">View-Reset</FONT> command will always restore
				the objects to these positions.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		 	 <li>
		    	As you play with your set you may find that some objects have been hidden
				behind other objects or do not overlay one another properly.&nbsp; For example,
				the bow should appear in front of the fuku.&nbsp; If the objects are not
				layered correctly you can adjust their layering order in the configuration
				file.<br>
		    	<br>
		    	Use the <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Adjust Layering</FONT> command to change the
				object layering order.&nbsp; Select the object of interest within the list and
				drag it to the proper position.&nbsp; Objects at the top of the list appear in
				front of all lower objects.&nbsp; If the list does not want to scroll down,
				ensure that your mouse pointer is near the lower left or lower right corner of
				the dialog window.&nbsp; Release the mouse button to drop the object.&nbsp; Use
				the OK button to apply your changes.
                                <br><br>
                                You can use the Undo button in the layer adjustment dialog to undo your change
                                if you make a mistake while adjusting the layers.  If you have applied your changes
                                and exited the layer dialog you can undo all the layering changes with the 
                                <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Undo Layer Adjustment</FONT> function on the main menu.
		    	<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; This
				time change the name to <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF2.cnf</FONT> .&nbsp; The new
				configuration file and the new imported images will be saved in the same
				directory as the original CNF1.cnf file.&nbsp; This will commit your changes
				and set the initial positions for all new imported objects to their current
				locations.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Check your work.&nbsp; You can pick up and move various objects as
				required.&nbsp; The <FONT color="#000099">View-Reset</FONT> command will
				restore the objects to their original positions.&nbsp; If you need to correct
				any object initial location, move the object to its desired position and use
				the <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Write Page</FONT> command to update the initial
				locations for all objects on the page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save</FONT> to save any object layering changes
				or initial location adjustments that you have made.  The name of the current archive 
                                or CNF file is displayed on the title bar of the main UltraKiss screen.
