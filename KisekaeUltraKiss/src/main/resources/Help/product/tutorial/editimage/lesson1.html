				This tutorial will show you how to convert and manipulate images for building
				objects in a KiSS set.&nbsp;We assume that you have drawn your images in some
				other tool and now wish to assemble the images into a KiSS set.&nbsp; Ensure that UltraKiss is
				showing the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing set.
				This lesson requires editing of the KiSS set so ensure that the Edit Enable toggle button
				on the toolbar is set.<img src="images/editenable.gif" width="16" height="16" hspace="5" align="absmiddle">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
                                This tutorial requires <FONT color="#cc6600">image files</FONT>.  If the necessary files cannot be found 
                                on your computer download the tutorial files using <FONT color="#000099">Help-Tutorial Files</FONT>.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-New</FONT>.&nbsp; This will create a new KiSS
				set at size (448,320) with a black border and one empty page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Properties</FONT> to change the new KiSS
				configuration (CNF) file properties.&nbsp; The attributes section of the
				Properties dialog will show a playfield size of (448,320).&nbsp; Press the
				small button beside this attribute and change the screen size to
				<FONT color="#cc6600">(800,600)</FONT>.&nbsp; Exit the configuration Properties dialog by
				pressing the OK button.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				This tutorial assumes that you need to convert your doll images to the CEL
				format typically uses in KiSS sets. There are two ways to do this. The easiest, of course, is to simply import the images into your KiSS set and allow UltraKiss to automatically convert the images to CEL format. We will show you how to do this shortly. First, we want to show you how to use the Image Editor tool to
				perform this conversion. Open the Image Editor with&nbsp;
				<FONT color="#000099">Tools-Image Editor</FONT>. With the Image Editor use
				<FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT> to load the <FONT color="#cc6600">body.gif</FONT> file
				from the Tutorial/Edit Image directory.
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				The Image Editor shows you the internal characteristics of the file.&nbsp; GIF
				images&nbsp;have internal palettes that are&nbsp;specific to&nbsp;the
				image.&nbsp; KiSS CELs are different.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cel images have palettes that
				are external to the image and&nbsp;stored in a KCF file.<BR>
				<BR>
				To convert the&nbsp;GIF image to a KiSS type CEL, use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT>
				and overtype the file name '<FONT color="#cc6600">gif</FONT>' extension with
				a '<FONT color="#cc6600">cel</FONT>' extension. Save the converted file into a directory
				of your choice. Press the SAVE button. The Image Editor will write two files -
				<FONT color="#cc6600">body.cel</FONT> and <FONT color="#cc6600">body.kcf</FONT>.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Repeat steps 4 and 5 to convert <FONT color="#cc6600">legs.gif</FONT> to a cel
				file.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				On the main UltraKiss screen use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to
				Selection</FONT>.&nbsp; Select the <FONT color="#cc6600">body.cel</FONT> and
				the <FONT color="#cc6600">legs.cel</FONT> files from the directory that you stored
				the files in.&nbsp; You can do separate imports for each image, or one combined
				import for both images if you use the <FONT color="#cc6600">ctrl key</FONT> to perform a multiple
				selection.&nbsp; On each subsequent dialog screen select the kcf file that
				matches the cel.&nbsp; The images will be loaded and positioned at the upper
				left corner of the playfield. Also, the background color of the set will change
				to match the first color in the first kcf file loaded.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Each image will have a green marquee box around it. The green lines show that
				the images are parts of a larger group, or a single object. In our case the body
				and legs are separate images that together make up the whole body.<br>
				<br>
				Drag the legs to position them properly below the body image. This adjusts the
				image offset relative to the body so that the whole object can be drawn
				properly.<br>
				<br>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Regroup</FONT> to consolidate the ungrouped
				images into a whole object. The marquee box will now be blue and will encase
				the complete body. You now have a consolidated KiSS object with its own object
				number.&nbsp; Drag the doll body to the center of the screen.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Now, either set the <FONT color="#000099">Tools-Options-Import-Import all images as CEL files</FONT> option,
				or press one of the viewer compatibility preset toggle buttons on the toolbar. The viewer presets automatically
				set this option to convert files to CEL images during import.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				On the main UltraKiss screen use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New
				Object</FONT>.&nbsp; Use the <FONT color="#cc6600">ctrl</FONT> key to simultaneously
				select <FONT color="#cc6600">shirt.gif</FONT>,
				<FONT color="#cc6600">skirt.gif</FONT>, <FONT color="#cc6600">shoes.gif</FONT>,
				<FONT color="#cc6600">bow.gif</FONT>, and <FONT color="#cc6600">thihighs.gif</FONT> files from the
				Tutorial/Edit Image directory. The images will be loaded and positioned at the upper
				left corner of the playfield.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Properly position the doll clothes on the doll body. You may find that some images go behind other
				images. Just position them as best you can as we will correct the layering order in the next step.
				When done, use<FONT color="#000099">Edit-Unselect All</FONT> or right-click anywhere on the backgound to
				unselect all the cels.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				You will find that the images do not overlay each other correctly.&nbsp; For
				example, the bow may slide behind the shirt or the shoes may show behind the
				stockings.&nbsp; Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Adjust Layering</FONT> to
				correct the problems.&nbsp; This will show a list of cels and their current
				draw levels.&nbsp; The drawing or layering order is always from top to bottom, in that the
				upper entries in the list overlay the lower entries.
				Click on any line that is out of position and drag the entry to the correct position.<BR>
				<BR>
				You can observe the layering effects in the preview window of the Layering
				dialog.&nbsp; When you are satisfied, click OK.<br>
			   <br>
				If the images are not quite properly positioned, move them to their correct locations. When you are satisfied,
				use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Write Page</FONT> or	<FONT color="#000099">View-Restart</FONT> to commit your
				changes and set the initial positions for all objects on the page.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				On the main UltraKiss screen use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Import Image to New
					Object</FONT>.&nbsp; Import the <FONT color="#cc6600">back.cel</FONT> file from the
				Tutorial/Edit Image directory. This image is
				a photographic picture that does not have a palette.&nbsp;JPG files are always converted to Cherry KiSS cels.&nbsp;
				However, the background cel is a full screen
				image. It will obscure all the doll files after it is layered on top of
				these images.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use <FONT color="#000099">Edit-Adjust Layering</FONT> and
				drag the background cel line to the bottom of the list, so that it has the
				lowest draw priority.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				You will  want to make the background fixed, so it cannot be picked up and
				moved.&nbsp; Place the mouse over any part of the background.&nbsp; Right click
				with the mouse and a popup menu for the object will appear.&nbsp; Select
				<FONT color="#000099">Image Context, Properties</FONT>.&nbsp; A dialog window for the background
				image will be shown and a picture of the background will be in the preview area
				of this window.<br>
				<br>
				Press the small button beside the <FONT color="#000099">Lock Value</FONT> setting
				in the attributes section.&nbsp; Enter the value 99999.&nbsp; Press the OK
				button to close the Properties dialog and then observe that the background can
				no longer be picked up and moved with the mouse.&nbsp; The lock value has fixed
				the image in place because the value 99999 exceeds the value set for a maximum
				fixed object.<BR>
				<BR>
				You may also want to set the <FONT color="#000099">Ghost</FONT> property for this
				image.&nbsp; This will make the background image completely non-responsive to
				mouse clicks.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now easily unselect&nbsp;previously selected
				objects by right-clicking anywhere on the image.&nbsp;
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; Save the
				new KiSS set to the Tutorial/Edit Image directory or a directory of your
				choice.&nbsp; The configuration element name should be <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF1.cnf</FONT>
				if you began this tutorial after first starting UltraKiss.&nbsp; You can
				overwrite any existing element of the same name.<BR>
				<BR>
				Note that when you save the configuration, all the cel and kcf files are saved,
				too. This will permanently update the CEL image offsets. For example, the legs that you attached to
				the body are offset from the upper left corner of the object. These offsets are written into the CEL
				file if the <FONT color="#000099">Tools-Options-Export-Write Image Offsets to CEL files</FONT> option
				is set. If you repeat this lesson without re-converting the GIF images to CELs you will discover
				that your cel images are properly positioned when imported.
