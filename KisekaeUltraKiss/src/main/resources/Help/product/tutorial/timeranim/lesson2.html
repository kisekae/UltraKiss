			<li>
				We will now adjust the airplane and smoke images&nbsp;so that the plane moves
				across the screen from left to right.&nbsp; Ensure that UltraKiss is showing
				the main logo screen.&nbsp; Close any existing data set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT>&nbsp; to load the configuration file <FONT color="#cc6600">
					CNF1.cnf</FONT> from the Tutorial/Kisimi directory or the directory you
				created in lesson 1.&nbsp; This will load the data set that you created.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Active Configuration</FONT> to open the text
				editor for the current configuration file.&nbsp; When the set loads we want to
				set up our airplane object so the smoke images are initially invisible.&nbsp;
				The only visible image in our airplane object group will be the actual
				airplane. The initialize() event can be used for this purpose.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Position the cursor at the end of the file and add the following lines:<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@EventHandler<br>
					;@initialize()<br>
					;@ unmap("smoke1.cel") unmap("smoke2.cel")<br>
				</font>
				<BR>
				<FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help
					documentation into your configuration file you must ensure that the semicolon
					and at-sign combination appears at the beginning of every line.</FONT>
				<BR>
				<br>
				The EventHandler statement begins the FKiSS event section.&nbsp; All commands
				except EventHandler must be written with lower case letters.&nbsp; The
				initialize() event is fired whenever a new data set is loaded.&nbsp; The
				unmap() commands explicitly set the named smoke images as invisible.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Animation is performed with a combination of timer() actions and alarm()
				events.&nbsp; A timer fires at a predefined time and causes an alarm() event to
				be executed.&nbsp; The alarm() code performs the animation work.&nbsp; We use
				the begin() event to set our first timer.&nbsp; The begin() event happens after
				initialize() and just before the loaded data set becomes visible on the
				screen.&nbsp; Add the following lines at the end of the configuration file:<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@begin()<br>
					;@ timer(1,1000)<br>
				</font>
				<BR>
				<FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help
					documentation into your configuration file you must ensure that the semicolon
					and at-sign combination appears at the beginning of every line.</FONT>
				<BR>
				<br>
				The timer action will cause alarm(1) to fire 1000 milliseconds after the data
				set starts.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				We must now define alarm(1).&nbsp; Every time the alarm is executed we will
				move the airplane object 9 pixels to the right and show the first puffing
				smoke.&nbsp; Add the following lines to the end of the configuration file.<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@alarm(1)<br>
					;@ map("smoke1.cel") move(#2,9,0) timer(2,100)<br>
					<br>
				</font>In 100 milliseconds we fire alarm(2).&nbsp; Alarm(2) turns off the first
				puff of smoke and turns on the second.&nbsp; Add the following lines to the end
				of the configuration file.<br>
                                <br>
                                Make sure that you specify the correct object number (#2) in the move() command.  
                                Use the object number for the group containing the eagle.cel and smoke1.cel and smoke2.cel.
				<br>
                                <br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@alarm(2)<br>
					;@ unmap("smoke1.cel") map("smoke2.cel") timer(3,100)<br>
					<br>
				</font>In 100 milliseconds we fire alarm(3).&nbsp; Alarm(3) turns off the
				second puff of smoke and repeats the animation sequence by rescheduling
				alarm(1) to fire in 250 milliseconds.&nbsp; Add the following lines to the end
				of the configuration file.<br>
				<br>
				<font face="Courier New">;@alarm(3)<br>
					;@ unmap("smoke2.cel") timer(1,250)<br>
					<br>
				</font>The sequence of alarm(1), alarm(2) and alarm(3) repeats over and over
				again.&nbsp; The repetition causes the airplane to move slowly across the
                                screen from left to right.<br>
				<BR>
				<FONT color="#cc6600">Note:&nbsp; If you copy and paste these lines from the help
					documentation into your configuration file you must ensure that the semicolon
					and at-sign combination appears at the beginning of every line.</FONT>
				<BR>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use the <FONT color="#000099">File-Exit</FONT> command in the text editor to
				apply your changes.&nbsp; If you happened to have made a typing mistake you
				will see an error when the changes are applied.&nbsp; If this occurs, re-edit
				the configuration file to correct any mistakes.&nbsp; If there are no errors
				the data set should reload and open to page 0 and the airplane should start to
				move across the screen.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">View-Restart</FONT> command to commit your changes
				and reload the data set.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				Use <FONT color="#000099">File-Save As</FONT> to save your work.&nbsp; If you saving
                                your work as elements inside a directory change the name to <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF2.cnf</FONT> .&nbsp; 
                                The new configuration file with the event code will be saved in the same directory as
				the original CNF1.cnf file.  If your files are maintained within an archive file,
                                save the archive file to a new name.  
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				To check your work use <FONT color="#000099">File-Open</FONT> to load the
				configuration file <FONT color="#cc6600">CNF2.cnf</FONT> from your
				directory.&nbsp; If you want you can pick up and move the airplane around as
				required.&nbsp; You may notice that the airplane tends to flit away from the
				mouse as it moves.&nbsp; This happens because the animation movements are
				conflicting with your mouse drags.&nbsp; You can prevent this from happening by
				turning off FKiSS object moves on mouse controlled objects.&nbsp; This option
				is found in the <FONT color="#000099">Options-Options-Compatibility</FONT> tab.<br>
				<br>
				The <FONT color="#000099">View-Reset</FONT> command will restore the objects to
				their original positions.
