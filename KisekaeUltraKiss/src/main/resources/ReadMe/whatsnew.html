                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Indicated that all tools should show at the front of the window hierarchy when invoked.  Linux systems did not always do this.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Ensured that the user preferences for screen sizes were reset when options were restored to factory options.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Established a new main Kisekae frame when the Search frame was closed.  Linux systems were not sizing the main frame properly.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Enabled the use of the @-character ("@map") on all single line FKiSS commands.  Previously this was permitted only in compatiblity mode.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. A set exit() command was not resetting all options to their initial values.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. Cached INCLUDE files were not being used if a connection to the original download website is refused.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. Defined a sixth application parameter which if set to "Webswing" indicates that UltraKiss is a Webswing application.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. Numerous changes were made to implement Webswing specific operation based on invokation on a Webswing server.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. New PrintLn.java and AudioWebswing.java classes are defined for Webswing specific printing and sound processing functions.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">18. The Owl Kiss set packaged with demonstration sets failed to load remote application files.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">19. UltraKiss 4.0 is now compiled and released with Open Java 17.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">1. A new UltraKiss visual application <b>"TheOwl.zip"</b> is distributed with UltraKiss 3.7.4.  This application enables downloads and execution of all Scarecrow sets.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. New sounds included in a wrapper file that loaded an appended configuration failed to play.  The sound was not referenced correctly from the original archive file.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. The FKiSS viewer("view","documents") or viewer("view","somefile.txt") failed to show documents contained in expansion sets.  This is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Corrected an issue where audio sounds transitioned to the mediaplayer would not be terminated after a restart and a new sound was played. Both sounds played concurrently. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Corrected a null pointer exception when specifying an expansion file that did not include a configuration element.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Corrected a String index out of bounds fault in the FKiSS Editor when creating a new event with File-New Event menu command. <b>Issue 2 on GitHub.</b></font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Implemented a multiple selection dialog to delete only selected cached files from the download cache directory.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Corrected the 32-bit architecture distribution of UltraKiss to actually use a 32 bit JVM.  Previously, a 64-bit JVM was packaged.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. Corrected the output filename for image cels when updated or exported cels are saved in non-archive files. <b>Issue 3 on GitHub.</b></font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Enabled audio file types as a type of file that can be saved on download.  Previously, only image files or archive files could be saved.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. Disabled the set restart capabilities if cels are exported during a set save.  The set must be reloaded as the cels have changed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. Corrected a memory leak related to audio files not releasing the sound listener when the configuration was closed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. The viewer("backcolor","rgb") command was not adjusting the background color if invoked through a hyperlink action.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. The Portal will now recognize a "#currentweb" url fragment so that the current website for download of KiSS sets by the Portal can be dynamically changed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. Added the OtakuWorld website to the online Portal for downloading KiSS sets to UltraKiss.  OtakuWorld provides access to over 4500 KiSS sets.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">16. A new wait dialog is shown for archive file downloads in the Portal.  Some connection requests can be slow.  This dialog advises of the issue. <b>Issue 1 on GitHub.</b></font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">17. Corrected the 32-bit distribution of UltraKiss.  The previous distribution was compiled with a version 11 Java that was not compatible with the version 8 JVM.</font></p>

					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. The SingleSound option for PlayFKiss compatibility caused intermittent event pauses when sounds were played.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Collision events were not being recognized on objects which were mapped or made visible after the mouse press.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. An updated collision event demonstration set "collide.lzh" FKiSS2 set is provided to test collisions when object visibility changes.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. The right click mouse recognition is refactored to use SwingUtilities rather than the Java 8 meta key.  This is for Java 11. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. A minimized frame was not being restored and made visible if selected through the Window menu.  This is corrected.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Collision events (collide, apart, in, out ...) were duplicated in the PageSet properties event list.  The duplicates are now removed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Ensured current sound was stopped before resetting sound to initiate another playback activity. Repeated sounds were sometimes not played.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Calls to label events in FKiSS code are now synchronized.  Parameter passing for gosub routines was not reentrant when using multiple event handlers.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. The Image Editor failed to properly close on exit and remained an active window.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. The notify() action command is extended to allow for an optional URL specification for an image.  See the notify() FKiSS documentation. </font></p>

					<P>UltraKiss V3.7 is released. This release improves memory utilization and resolves memory leaks.</P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V3.7&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. A new option to reduce the Media Player background sound volume is provided.  See the Options-Media tab.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. UltraKiss now configures a maximum memory pool of 50% available memory with bundled installers.  The log file now shows the maximum memory the JVM will use.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. A new edit selection of all visible objects is now available in the Edit menu.  This option selects the visible subset of all objects on the screen. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Audio sound caching now works if caching is disabled and/or enabled.  Previously sounds would not work if caching was disabled.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Enhanced the cel and object properties dialog to display and enable attribute display based on the cel page set context.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Implemented a new compatibility feature to allow page sets to be treated as loadable scenes for page 0.  Memory use for sets that use many large cels can now be managed by placing these cels in separate scenes.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Set saves when expansion sets are in use are corrected to write only the original archive contents.  Previously, all elements including those from expansion sets could be written to the primary archive file.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Set restarts when the set was loaded from directory folders could fail to properly load and play some audio files.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. Original cel images are now flushed when copied on a set restart to release internal image memory.  Previously, unloaded original images could contribute to increased memory use.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. INCLUDE file objects are now retained across set restarts.  Previously, the file directory contents were reestablished and this could contribute to increased memory use.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. The Text Editor Find-Replace function would not find and replace new text without repositioning the document cursor to the top of the file.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. An Edit Undo All function is now implemented for the Text Editor tool.  Previously only single edits could be undone.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. The edit selection process did not select fully transparent pixels made transparent through a KiSS cel transparency setting.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. Corrected a memory leak in the File Loader on repeated set restarts or loads by properly terminating the file loader thread.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. Corrected a memory leak in the Media Player by closing the input data stream when audio files were closed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">16. Corrected a memory leak where GIF images did not properly establish cloned frame palettes on a restart.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">17. A restart due to a configuration file syntax error edit could fail when working with directory files. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">18. Corrected a memory leak where audio file playback could retain system resources after the audio file was stopped. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">19. Component cel changes through FKiSS action commands were restructured to run on the AWT thread and wait for completion. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">20. The Media Player asynchronous load activity was not interrupted if another media play request was issued. This is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">21. A new FIND feature was implemented for the Active Objects dialog to facilitate finding objects by name in the object tree. </font></p>

 	              <p><font face="Arial">5. The last modified time and date stamp for updated elements written to an archive file is corrected.  Previously this timestamp could be 0.</font></p>
 	              <p><font face="Arial">6. Strong attachment chains now treat object fix values of 1 as if the object is not fixed.  The attachment is not strong as the object will be unfixed.</font></p>

					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V3.6&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. Numerous corrections are made to ensure valid restart processing when expansion sets are loaded or options are changed that require a set reload.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Collision recognition could fail if the FKissEditor was used and a user event sequence that changed cel visibility was missed for collision state recognition.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. Exporting GUI components as CEL files failed to work if components were not updated. These components will now be converted if the appropriate export option is set.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Closing a set where the CNF configuration file was edited with the TextEditor failed to issue a prompt to save the file.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. The TextEditor find and replace dialog did not allow cursor focus into the search text field if the text was not found.  This is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. The FKissEditor will no longer pause breakpoint on label events.  These events are not top level events but are rather gosub or goto calls within another event.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Alarm sequencing in the AlarmTimer and EventHandler is refined to use the alarm trigger time as well as CNF order for similar delay timer actions.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. An intermittent NullPointerException that occurred after set load in the Swing Java library code is resolved.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. An event timing window that would prevent some alarms from being queued and processed has been corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. A new compatibility option is defined to enable multiple event declarations for the same object.  PlayFKiss does not support this behavior.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. The FKissEditor, when breakpointed and the cursor hovers over the event, will now display the source event from where the event was invoked.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. The Scarecrow sets are now recognized on load and the appropriate PlayFKiss compatibility mode options are now automatically set.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. Border color specifications in PlayFKiss compatibility mode now use the default PlayFKiss color palette when no palette file is specified.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. Set loading now reports missing mandatory FKiSS event and action parameters. Previously, if parameters were not delimited properly these errors could be missed.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">3. Adjusted the URL download progress to indicate a File Not Found error if the URL reported a FileNotFound exception.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Media Player adjusted to properly minimize and restore during playback.  Minimized players can now be restored from the UltraKiss main Window menu item.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Introduced '#nocopy' url reference tag for online KiSS set links to disable Save and edit capability on download.  This restricts distribution based on author restrictions.</font></p>
 	              <p><font face="Arial">3. Restored the ability to view set documentation, configuration, and palette files from the View menu.  The archive file contents list had been erroneously cleared.</font></p>
 	              <p><font face="Arial">4. Introduced a new option 'DefaultPlayFKiss' in the Option Dialog compatibility tab. This will assume PlayFKiss compatibility for all sets that cannot be identified on load.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">3. Exporting images to alternate image types is corrected to properly write transparent color %c in the CNF for BMP type images.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Converting from truecolor images or other images with more than 256 colors to GIF type images now dithers the image to 256 colors.</font></p>

					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. A set reload is required if the PlayFkiss compatibility options are specified when a set is loaded.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. The option to restrict FKiSS movement to the playfield only applies to visible objects.  Previously, unmapped objects were also restricted.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. The Archive Manager tool was not correctly maintaining directory entries for conversion between ZIP and LZH files.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. CRC32 values are now calculated for LHA elements and used for ZIP file output when writing uncompressed elements.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">5. A new Sound option to force single sound playback is introduced for PlayFKiss compatibility.  PlayFKiss stops the current sound when a new sound is played.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">6. PlayFKiss compatibility requires that collision events must be processed after press events and unfix events.  Previously, UltraKiss performed collision testing before unfix processing.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">7. Object Group and Image Cel property dialogs now show Alarm events related to the object.  This provides improved visibility into event processing logic.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">8. Selected Events and Alarms can now be both breakpoint selected and trace disabled within the property dialogs using the middle mouse button.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">9. The FKissEditor tool has a new option to disable all events from being traced.  This allows for improved tracing of user selected events.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">10. Event and action traces for disabled events will no longer show in the log file by default.  A new option to force logging of trace disabled events now exists.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">11. Writes of updated elements to an archive file failed to use directory paths leading to duplicated elements in the archive file.</font></p>
	              <p><font face="Arial">12. Syntax processing of the CNF would fail to attach FKiSS actions to events if a prior syntax error had occurred.</font></p>

					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V3.3&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. Restart of sets with compatibility presets would not retain the preset option for writing cel images with offsets. This could lead to incorrect image placement if set was saved after a restart.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Image errors on loading of a saved set could occur if non-cel image types had been imported into the set and the Import Images as Cel option or compatibility options had been set and a set reload had been done prior to set save. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. BMP or other images with exactly 256 colors and no transparent color would not be saved correctly as CEL images. The generated KiSS palette  file would not correctly represent the dithered image colors necessary to maintain space for the KiSS transparent index in the palette. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Importing the first non-cel palette type image with the Import as Cel option set was not setting the UltraKiss border color to the background color of the palette. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Non-cel images, when exported as cel types, were not being written as Cherry KiSS or truecolor images. Images could be converted to palette type cels and this could cause missing palette errors on load of the converted set. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. If an image was cut from the set and replaced with an imported image that maintained a different palette with the same name as an existing palette in the set, then the existing palette was not updated to the new palette colors. This could result in improper image colors after a set restart or save. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. The FKiSS Editor tool now shows only the events contextually relevent to the selected image or object if the Edit Event selection is made from image or object property dialogs or selected object context menus. Previously the FKiSS Editor would always show all  events.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Palette type BMP images without a transparent color specified through a %c tag could assume that the first palette color was transparent when the  image was exported or converted to a new image type. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. The Use Path Names option is now set as the default value for archive file exports. Previously, CNF files which identified cels or palettes using relative path names would not load successfully after a File-Save As Files command as the full directory structure was not created. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Undo of edit selection for input components such as toggle buttons or checkboxes or lists could fail to properly restore or cancel the component input property. This could lead to failure to undo an import of the component. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. Property dialogs were not bringing the FKiSS Editor to the front if the Edit Events actions were selected and the property dialog had been previously invoked from the FKiSS Editor tool. This behaviour is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. The syntax for read() and write() command statements  for file input and output operations has changed to maintain consistency with file open(), close() and edit() commands. The file name now consistently appears as the second argument in all file input and output statements. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. DirectKiss valuepool functionality is now fully implemented. Previously, valuepools would not work correctly. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. Text file cursors were not visible on new text file creation unless the Word Wrap option was set. This problem is bypassed by setting the wordwrap option as the default when new text files are opened.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. Move() commands for image cels were not being restricted to the playfield boundaries if FKiSS moves were limited by user option. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">16. <strong>Event and Action command signatures and help text are now displayed as tool tips when  editing FKiSS code with the FKiSS Editor tool</strong>. This provides visible reminders of the proper command syntax whenever the cursor hovers over a command name. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">17. The UltraKiss Portal was not always showing the required portal page if the UltraKiss options were viewed. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">18. <strong><font color="#FF0000">UltraKiss is now fully distributed  with Java Web Start technology on Apple, Windows, and Linux platforms. </font></strong>Individual system installers are no longer supported. Java Web Start provides an automatic download and update service to maintain software currency with one consistent release package.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">19. The  edit selection menu for  object selection and grouping now provides  an  unselect option for selected objects. This is a new undoable operation that facilitates unselecting individual objects within a selection set. </font></p>

					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V3.2a&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. Fixed palette group settings applied to cels through  setpal() requests were not being retained across page set changes.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Reset requestsand set restart commands were not restoring initial palettes and palette groups possibly changed through setpal() and setkcf() commands. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. Image offset values set through the image properties dialog may not have been retained when the set was saved. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Explicit %offset[] tags maintained in the CNF were not being retained on a set save for CEL type images. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. A transparency problem on Apple systems where images could become more transparent than expected has been resolved.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Editing a CNF with syntax errors  failed to find new imported images on a set restart when the corrected CNF was loaded. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Modifying the 'Import Images as Cel files' option after images had been newly imported considered  new images as cels when the set was saved. This could result in improper image output on write. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. If page context was used to identify ambiguous cels in conjunction with the option to apply visibility and other action commands to all ambiguous cels, not all ambiguous cels were modified. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. Image caching is now the default option. Previously, images were not cached by default. This could contribute to performance delays on page changes for large sets with many images on a page as images had to be decompressed and restored on each page change. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Cel images, when exported, were being written as Cherry KiSS or truecolor images. This could cause loss of palette capabilities for palette type cels when UltraKiss sets were being converted to operate on other viewers. Exported cels will now retain their original palette or truecolor type.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. The repeat() statement was modifying the repetition limit value within the repeat label module for limits  specified with a variable. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. The FKiSS moveto() action command for cels was not correcting for cel base offsets. This could lead to incorrect cel positioning on a moveto() action command applied to a cel. </font></p>

The Search module is now easier to use and visually explains the process it follows.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. The UltraKiss Portal now provides direct access to the search index files created by the Search module. Previously, the portal could access this index through the File-Index command, but this was not intuitive. New toolbar buttons are provided to easily locate the master index for KiSS set access. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. PlayFKiss alarm scheduling when multiple alarms fire at the same time was found to process alarms in the sequence in which they are defined in the CNF configuration file. The event scheduling sequence is critical for sets that assume sequential execution and a defined event order. The CNF order is now assumed when PlayFKiss compatibility is set. Scarecrow sets may now run more correctly.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Corrections for a previous timing window that allowed stopped alarms to run was not fully correct. The problem is resolved by verifying alarm state only when the alarm first begins execution. This fault may have manifested itself as some alarm actions not executing.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. The OK and Cancel buttons on the Options dialog were not functioning for some option changes. This problem is corrected. </font></p>

					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <p><font face="Arial">1. The Edit-Paste New command was not creating new cels if the objects were pasted into a different page. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Literal floating point values coded in FKiSS action commands were not being interpreted correctly. Integer decoding was being performed. This problem is resolved. The Calculator application is enhanced to validate floating point arithmetic. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. A new action command: math(&quot;function&quot;,variable,operand,operand,...) has been defined to calculate standard mathmatical functions of one or more variables. Functions currently implemented are &quot;abs&quot;, &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot;, &quot;tan&quot;, &quot;log&quot;, &quot;exp&quot;, &quot;pow&quot;, floor&quot;, &quot;ceil&quot;, &quot;round&quot;, &quot;sqrt&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, &quot;asin&quot;, &quot;acos&quot;, &quot;atan&quot;, &quot;todegrees&quot;, and &quot;toradians&quot;. Floating point values are returned for the result variable unless the function computes an integer result. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. A new action command: format(String,Number,MaxFractionDigit,MinFractionDigit,MaxIntegerDigit,MinIntegerDigit) is defined to facilitate string formatting of decimal numbers. The minimum and maximum fractional and integer digit display can be specified when converting numeric values to string representations. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Corrections were made to the Color Editor palette and image cel selection controls to ensure correct operation. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. A new option has been defined in the Edit section to preset the initial toolbar edit selection toggle state. The factory default state remains off.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Property dialogs for KiSS cels, objects, and all other entities are now opened to match the size of the parent window. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Initial debug options were no longer being recognized on set load. This problem was introduced with the FKiSS trace window feature and is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. DirectKiss has been observed to fire set() events on changeset() action commands coded during intialize() events. UltraKiss fired set() events when the playfield is visible as would occur during begin(). DirectKiss behaviour is now implemented as a compatibility change. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Celgroup specifiers, when following the cel line and preceded be a non-celgroup comment line, were being recognized as new celgroups for the cel. The preceding comment should terminate the parse for celgroup association.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. <strong>The UltraKiss InstallAnywhere installer now sets the Java maximum memory pool to 200 MB.</strong> This will improve capability for UltraKiss to manage large sets. </font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">2. Transparent pixels in non-input components were not being recognized as being transparent for object selection. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. A warning dialog is now displayed if a KiSS set is being saved and components are being converted to cel images. This conversion is non-recoverable, therefore the warning allows for confirmation before the save.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. A timing window existed where an alarm could fire and be queued in the EventHandler when another concurrent event attempted to schedule the same alarm. This could result in multiple instances of the alarm being  scheduled. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Exported files were not necessarily maintaining cel offsets  in image files that supported offset values. File exports were using their own offset capability rather than the destination type capabilities. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Configuration file edits on new KiSS sets that had not been saved may not have been applied to the active configuration.This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Mouse up events were being queued and not  fired  in a single thread mode if the ImmediateEvent compatibility option was set. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Excessive scaling could lead to loss of image information. Scale factors are now limited to a minimum reduction of 0.1 and a maximum magnification of 100. </font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial">11. Removing items from list or combobox components now clears the component item selection. Previously, other items could become selected if a selected item was removed. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. <strong>A new Trace FKiSS window option is now available.</strong> This option will display a trace panel on loaded sets to visually monitor FKiSS code as it executes.

					<P>UltraKiss V3.0 is released. This release improves keyboard handling and corrects various issues with components and ungrouped images. Testing of visual editing capabilities has been performed to resolve issues with image import, export, selection, object ungrouping, and  positioning of cels and groups.

					<P><strong>UltraKiss is now significantly more robust and stable. </strong></P>
					<P>Many FKiSS event and action commands have been tested and verified for correct operation. New Help documentation with  example test sets for every  event and action command under various FKiSS levels is under construction. Qualification test sets under various FKiSS levels for alarm(), apart(), begin(), catch(), col(), collide(), detached(), drop(), end(), and keypress() events are now provided in the demonstration system packaged with the UltraKiss extensions. New demonstration sets for a Calculator and the Tic-Tac-Toe game are also included. </P>

                      <p><font face="Arial">1. Textfield and Textarea components now support left and right justification of text.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">2.Newly imported or edited images may not have been saved after an Edit-New Group  if the set had not been restarted. This problem is corrected by retaining the original image copy state for internal images created after an Edit-Cut operation. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. <strong>FKiSS numeric calculations add(), sub(), mul(), div(), mod() and sqrt()  now support double precision and floating point arithmetic.</strong> </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. The FKiSS Editor breakpoint processing was not always returning to the correct statement after an exitevent() command. This problem could occur in label events that looped on a goto() statement.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Corrections have been made to the image export function to correct positioning errors. Previously, when exporting images to an alternate image format transparent color and offset information may not have been written to the new configuration file. This could cause image display problems when the exported set was loaded. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Object groups with offsets may not have been positioned properly on a set restart after edits. Ungrouped objects have their group offsets set to zero if updated through edit actions. This could cause object positioning faults on a set restart as initial object positions were not being reset. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. <strong>Images can now be resized with the mouse.</strong> Expanding or contracting the ungrouped image selection rectangle scales the image to fit within the adjusted bounding area. Image size changes are an undoable edit.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. Undo of pasted ungrouped images could remove both the pasted copy and the original image from the object. The original image remained marked in the selection set. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. The Image Editor could corrupt the  object group bounding box size if the image  was cropped and edits were discarded on exit.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. <strong>Numerous corrections have been made to improve keyboard handling.</strong> The UltraKiss keytype() event was not recognizing certain shift key combinations for upper case key events. FKiSS keypress() and keyrelease() events were not  recognizing certain control keys and upper case keys that were not alphabetic. Keyboard events now recognize all key on the keyboard, including control keys, modifier keys, and function keys.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. A null pointer exception saving newly created files in the Text Editor is resolved. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. Alarm local parameter variables may not have been set to the correct values for self-referencial alarms. Parameter values on the timer() statement could change  values prior to being set. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. The configuration cel order, when recreated, was not reflecting the proper z-layering if objects had been pasted. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. Color set selection through &lt;alt&gt; Page Up and &lt;alt&gt; Page Dn keyboard commands was not always working. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. Notify dialogs were enabled for text entry. This could cause unexpected charcters to be inserted if notification dialogs were shown on keyboard commands. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">16. <strong>Numerous corrections have been made to improve component handling.</strong> New border attributes are defined to enable various border types to be displayed around the component. Component images could not always be saved as cel images. Component  attributes that contained a comma as part of any text string failed to parse correctly.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">17. File Save commands may not have reset the file update state which led to an improper prompt to save the set when the set was  closed. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">18. A null pointer exception that could occur if the Alarm Timer was disabled has been resolved. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">19. <strong>Numerous corrections have been made to improve ungrouped image editing.</strong> Many positioning problems have been resolved to correct faults with ungrouped image editing. Many  problems have been corrected with component editing that led to incorrect offsets or positioning faults if the set was saved and later reloaded. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">20. Detached() events   were not being fired for  unfixed parent objects in an attachment chain if fixed children were being dragged. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">21. Corrections have been made to attached object manipulation through mouse and FKiSS move commands. New compatibility options are implemented to enable DirectKiss backward compatibility. Detachment can be disabled on restricted objects during moves, strong attachments with fixed objects can be disabled, and detachment on FKiSS moves can be disabled. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">22. Alarm sequences can now be intitiated and processed during end() events. Previously, alarms started during end() events would be terminated when the set was closed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">23. <strong>Collision events in(), out(), stillin(), and stillout() are corrected for cel group processing.</strong> Previously, UltraKiss was not registering collision events between two cel groups  for these events. </font></p>

These adjusted offsets were being retained for set restarts or configuration updates. FKiSS modified offsets are temporary adjustments to the configuration.This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. A  performance improvement was made to the cel bounding box function to eliminate new object creation on the heap. This may  ease garbage collection requirements for smoother animation.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. Unnamed audio files used to terminate sound(&quot;&quot;), music(&quot;&quot;), and movie(&quot;&quot;)  action commands could generate a File Not Found error on load. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5.<strong>Video images can now be imported into the KiSS set.</strong> Video cels are   movies that can be positioned, dragged, mapped, unmapped, and participate in FKiSS events. Note that video cels are windows displayed on top of all other cels. Java Media Framework  must be installed for video cel capabilities. See Help-Read Me for installation instructions.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. Video attributes can now be set through the object context menu. New attributes to show movie playback and positioning controls, auto repeat, and frame border display are available. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. Imported images  saved as cel images could cause File Not Found errors on a subsequent load of the saved set. This problem could occur if the option to save imported images as cel files was set after the image was imported. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. <strong>Numerous corrections have been made to improve video cel stability.</strong> Video cels are now shown when mapped and hidden when unmapped.  Video cel playback is now maintained across page shifts. Ambiguous video cels can have independent movie playback controls. Video cels are no longer duplicately written on configuration saves. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9. Selected video cels can now be resized. Movie playback is scaled to fill the specified area.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Video cel and component cel size changes are now undoable edits. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. Video cel attribute changes and component cel attribute changes are now undoable edits. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. The last referenced file history was not appearing in the menu bar when a new KiSS set was created. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. Audio sounds may have shown a File Not Found error on a second playback if Java Media Framework was installed. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. UltraKiss sets with page numbers greater than 10 were treating the page number as if it was of the form 012345679 on load. The previous fix for this problem was not fully correct. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. Sounds may not have stopped playing on a sound(&quot;&quot;) or music(&quot;&quot;) request. This problem was introduced with the sound fixes for Java 1.5. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">16. Audio and video files may have exhibited a File Not Found error during a File-Save. This problem resulted from an attempt to write unnamed media files. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">17. <strong>Edit-New Group was not maintaining  edit offset adjustments for selected group objects that were combined into a new group.</strong> This could show up as an object positioning problem on a set restart. This problem is corrected for both New Group operations and Undo/Redo of New Group operations.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">18. GIF images maintain internal offsets as do CEL images, but UltraKiss was not considering GIF images in this way for offset determination in the CNF file. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">19. Images written in GIF format were not using current offset values when the image was saved. This could cause improper image positioning if the image offset was changed and the set was reloaded. This problem is corrected. </font></p>

					<P>UltraKiss V2.2c is released. This release  corrects issues with tag prefixes and other miscellaneous usability faults.</P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.2c&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. The exitloop() action command was failing to set the initialization state for subsequent repeat() commands. This could cause repeat() loop variables to not initialize correctly. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. FKiSS tag prefixes such as % and !, if used in string literals within the FKiSS comment section, could be interpreted as valid prefixes when generating a CNF file. This problem is corrected by eliminating string literal characters during parsing of the FKiSS comments.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. Set restarts with pasted images of type JPG, PNG, BMP, and PPM could double cel offset values and position cels incorrectly. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. A new Paste New command is defined to create new cel files when pasting copied objects or images. This command enables the creation of new cels rather than ambiguous cels. New cel files have unique numeric suffixes appended to the cel name and are created when the configuration is saved. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. <strong>UltraKiss will now interpret FKiSS tags (%) in any sequence on the cel definition line.</strong> Previously, UltraKiss would only parse tags correctly if they appeared in the order %t, %g, %u, %c, %size, %offset, %x, %y, and %attributes. Tags must appear first, before any cel group specifications and  any trailing comment text. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. UltraKiss initial window position and size is no longer modified if the Tutorial system is on display. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. Export of ambiguous cels to a new image type failed to  update the CNF cel name for the ambiguous cel. This would retain the original image name in the exported CNF file.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. The File-Save As Archive command was attempting to write component cels as files. Components do not exist as files and this introduced File Not Found errors. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. The URL load window is now brought in front of the main UltraKiss frame if KiSS sets are automatically loaded with the UltraKiss applet. Previously, the load window could remain in the background. </font></p>

					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.2b&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. A memory leak associated with repeated sound file  playback has been resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. Unloaded cels were not being saved during a configuration Save As command. This problem could occur if a new KiSS set was being saved and images were not cached in memory. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3 Audio files can now be imported into a configuration. Previously, an attempt to import new audio clips could result in a null pointer exception. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. <strong>The ability to  export image files to different image types during a File-Save As is now implemented.</strong> This feature requires  the Tools-Options-Export-Export all Images option be set and the appropriate image type be selected. The KiSS configuration file is automatically updated to reference the new image types for subsequent set loads. Note that an export to CEL image types writes truecolor Cherry KiSS cels.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Problems copying, pasting, and importing component cels into ungrouped objects are resolved. Previously,  components may not have been displayed and component attributes could not be changed. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. The calculation of image offsets with ungrouped cel cut, paste, edit undo,  move() actions, or set restart operations is corrected. Previously, offset values could be computed as negative numbers when the  new object group boundaries were established. This could lead to incorrect object positioning. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. A problem with incorrect image multipalettes being set on initial page switches is resolved. Previously, color changes could be dropped for ambiguous cels that required loading when a page switch occurred. Note that DirectKiss does not apply the page palette when switching to a new page. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Image colors were not always being restored to their original palette after a contextual change had occurred to view image properties. This problem is resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. <strong>The UltraKiss tutorials are updated.</strong> The tutorials now show how to use  UltraKiss to create KiSS sets compatible with other viewers. The Help Tutorial page now contains a description of the learning objectives for each tutorial.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. New component names are now guaranteed to be unique within a configuration. Previously, adding new GUI components could duplicate  cel or component names in a  loaded set.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. A new compatibility option to apply FKiSS property changes to  all ambiguous cels is implemented. Action commands for map(), unmap(), altmap(), ghost(), and transparent()  can now be applied to  ambiguous cels concurrently. This option is implemented for DirectKiss compatibility.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. The Color Editor was failing to unload image cels temporarily loaded for preview display. This could result in improper image positioning when the image was subsequently used. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. <strong>New corrections are applied to the Image Editor to implement previously incomplete work.</strong> Image transformations and color changes can now  be applied to the KiSS set. Experimental edge detection functions are removed. Color and geometry changes can now be cummulatively applied to the image on display Note that image edits applied to the KiSS set from the Image Editor convert the cel image to truecolor, or a Cherry KiSS cel. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. A problem with the Layer Adjustment facility  could result in an inability to move a selection line in the image overlay order and cause numerous redraws of the preview image. This problem has been resolved. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. Image offsets could be created if group objects were duplicately pasted and the original group had been moved. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. Pasted cels could be created using an existing cel number. This resulted in a duplicate cel number that manifested itself as a problem adjusting the cel overlay order during Layer Adjustments. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. Imported images, subsequently copied and pasted onto a page different from the start page of the set, could generate a file not found error on a set restart. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">18. Imported object groups copied and pasted on different pages were not being correctly positioned after a set save or a set restart. This problem is  resolved for newly imported objects only. Copy and paste of non-imported object groups onto different pages may not  show at their adjusted positions if the pasted group object is moved. To ensure that new initial positions are established on a new page, use Edit-Write Page. </font></p>

					<P>UltraKiss V2.2a is updated. This release  corrects a few issues with the recent compatibility enhancements. </P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.2a&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. A new PlayFKiss specific parameter syntax table is implemented to differentiate PlayFKiss syntax from DirectKiss. Previously, syntax errors could be reported for PlayFKiss sets with iffixed(), ifnotfixed(), setfix() and unfix() commands for cel name arguments that DirectKiss does not support. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. A timing window was discovered between alarm events concurrently updating the display  with mouse events. This fault may have resulted in action event error termination during a redraw request or the possible loss of object display during mouse movement. Synchronization locks are implemented in an attempt to resolve this problem.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. The preset options for PlayFKiss compatibility was not setting the ImmedateCollide option. This could result in improper action sequences as PlayFKiss interrupts event actions to immediately process collision events on move() commands. This problem is corrected. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. New corrections have been applied in an attempt to better synchronize FKiSS object moves applied to mouse selected objects. Previously, the FKiSS move() did not consider mouse drag displacement. This could result in improper object positioning or flicker during drag operations.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. FKiSS invalid action name errors will now recover the syntax parse from the next action statement. Previously, UltraKiss would discard remaining actions in the event and recover from the next event statement. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. Neither PlayFKiss or DirectKiss fire collision events when objects are moved from their current positions on page changes. UltraKiss collision events on page changes are no longer processed if a compatibility preset is selected. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. UltraKiss interpretation of cel page set specifications of the form 012345679 had been disabled with the new syntax validation. This problem is corrected for sets that limit the maximum page sets to 10 or less. Scarecrow Bathtime now operates more correctly.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. A new compatibility option to disable warning messages for undefined variables or objects is implemented. Previously, UltraKiss would identify all such undefined entities and this could result in numerous syntax warning messages for some KiSS sets.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. <strong>UltraKiss will now automatically assume PlayFKiss compatibility for all KiSS sets if a compatibility preset is not selected and the configuration file is not recognized as an UltraKiss specific configuration. </strong></font></p>

					<P>UltraKiss V2.2 is released. This release  implements many corrections to enhance PlayFKiss  compatibility. </P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.2&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. <strong>New viewer compatibility preset buttons are provided on the toolbar.</strong> Compatibility presets can be used to automatically set the proper options to emulate PlayFKiss, DirectKiss, and GnomeKiss behavior. Furthermore, when compatibility options are preset, imported images and non-input GUI components will be automatically converted to Cel format files and saved as such during set editing. UltraKiss should now emulate PlayFKiss correctly. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. We have determined that PlayFKiss verifies object collision state after press() events are processed. We have also confirmed that apart() events are processed before collide() events. This sequence is assumed by the Scarecrow sets. UltraKiss collision processing is modified to adhere to this process when PlayFKiss or DirectKiss compatibility options are set.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. PlayFKiss does not fire collision events on FKiSS movebyx() and movebyy()  action commands. A new compatibility option is implemented to configure UltraKiss to operate in this manner and disable UltraKiss recognition of such collisions. Previously, UltraKiss would recognize collisions upon each action if the compatibility option to apply collision events on every action statement was set, or upon event termination if this option was not set. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. A timing window was discovered that allowed alarms to be enabled for execution concurrently with alarm scheduling. This could result in alarms processing out of sequence from their scheduling order. Scarecrow sets are dependent on specific event order. This problem has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. <strong>FKiSS object movement  can now be limited to the visible object boundaries.</strong> Previously, movement was restricted to the actual object boundaries. This new compatibility option to limit movement to visible state now applies when either mouse movement or FKiSS object movement is restricted to the playfield boundaries. Movement restrictions can be  set with th FKiSS moves general options.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. A new compatibility option to apply user mouse down events and collision events on the system event handler is implemented. Previously, such events were queued to execute on an independent thread. This new option enforces sequential event execution as  implemented by PlayFKiss and DirectKiss, but this has the detrimental effect of locking the user  interface during event processing.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. PlayFKiss calculates object fix state before mouse down events are processed. GnomeKiss updates fix state after mouse down events are processed. A new early fix state compatibility option is implemented to configure this choice.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Many viewers fire unfix events for cels or objects that are not visible. UltraKiss previously restricted unfix events to fire only for visible cels and objects. A new compatibility option is defined to enable or disable unfix event firing for unmapped cels and objects.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. Alarms may not have terminated after a timer(Alarm,0) action command was processed. The previous correction for this timing window  was not fully correct.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10.<strong> New FKiSS syntax verification checks are implemented.</strong> UltraKiss will now correctly identify and report incorrect use of parameters on all FKiSS action and event statements. Parameter checks are invoked if the strict syntax checking  option is set, which is the default for all compatibility options. With viewer compatiblity options set, most syntax  is verified according to the DirectKiss FKiSS 4 implementation. When compatibility options are not set, UltraKiss verifies syntax according to the enhanced UltraKiss FKiSS 5 implementation. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. Label component text without a specified foreground color are corrected to display a contrasting color to the set background.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. Undo and redo of image imports and component imports now correctly retains the set background color. Previously, the background color could be set to black.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. The ability to ignore FKiSS object moves on mouse selected objects, as specified by the compatibility option to retain mouse control after FKiSS object movement, was not functioning correctly. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. For alarms scheduled to fire at the same time, UltraKiss may not have scheduled alarms in the same sequence as they were queued. Scheduled alarm sequence is assumed by the Scarecrow sets. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. A new View-Load Messages menu command is defined to enable display the loader syntax messages and error messages after set load. </font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. An LHA invalid file signature error has been resolved by assuming that invalid LHA headers represent an end-of-file situation. Apparently, some LHA archivers do not properly terminate the file with a zero byte. </font></p>

					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.1a&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. UltraKiss iffixed() and ifnotfixed() action commands are corrected to test the fix state of the object for cel arguments. Previously, UltraKiss tested the fix state of the cel. This correction implements PlayFKiss compatibility. DirectKiss does not support cel name arguments for the iffixed() and ifnotfixed() action commands. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">2. Additional corrections to unfix processing have been applied to more closely emulate PlayFKiss and DirectKiss. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">3. Additional compatibilty  options are implemented to more closely configure UltraKiss to emulate PlayFKiss and DirectKiss operation. The main compatibility option enforces sequential event processing on the user event thread. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">4. <strong>Cel transparency changes with settransparent() commands now run approximately three times as fast.</strong> Transparency adjustments are now applied using the AlphaComposite drawing class.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">5. Object movement, if limited to the playfield boundaries, is now constrained to the visible object state by default. A new compatibility interface option is provided to institute previous behaviour where object movement, if limited, was constrained to the object boundaries.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">6. UltraKiss will no longer automatically reset input focus to the playfield when the screen is redrawn. This could cause the UltraKiss window to appear in front of tool windows at inappropriate times.</font></P>

                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. <strong>Control of the set FKiSS event run state   is now provided on the toolbar as a toggle switch</strong>. This new toggle switch enables suspension of the event handler if set edit functions are required. The button displays a green icon when the event handler is running, a red icon when it is stopped, and a yellow icon when it will stop on the next breakpoint. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">2. Alarms could potentially not  fire during configuration activation due to a thread timing problem. This issue is resolved by yielding thread control to enable the necessary timer activity notification to proceed. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">3. Page deletion failed to  set the internal cel state for deleted cels on the page. This retained cels in the active configuration that were not associated with any page. A new insertion for the deleted page and an repeat import of the deleted cel could lead to duplicate cel references in the configuration. This problem is corrected. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">4. A hang problem that occurred when movie playback ended has been corrected. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">5. The Save as Archive and Save as Files commands now no longer display the Archive Manager tool. Save operations show only the file save progress window.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">6. A null pointer exception that could occur when centering windows that did not have a parent frame has been resolved.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">7. <strong>Object properties now display the  preview image in all cases.</strong> Previously, preview images would not be displayed for unloaded images.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">8. Mouse control is now released on FKiSS windowsize action statements. This corrects a problem where images could change position on mouse movement after a window size change.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">9. The playfield screen is now fully recomposited on a mouse release. Previously, FKiSS object movements that attempted to position an object outside the playfield bounds during mouse press events, when boundary enforcement was active, could cause the object to not be displayed.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">10. GUI components can now have their text attribute cleared or set to an empty string. </font></P>

					<P>UltraKiss V2.1 is updated to improve PlayFKiss and DirectKiss compatibility.</P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.1&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. <strong>Unfix event processing has been adjusted to follow the PlayFKiss and DirectKiss standard.</strong> Unfix events now fire on mouse down when the  mouse action will reduce the object fix count to zero. Previously, UltraKiss fired  unfix events on mouse down when the unfix count had been set to zero.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">2. The Compatibilty Options section of the UltraKiss Options dialog has been expanded to more clearly identify the feature differences affecting UltraKiss behaviour. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">3. <strong>Compatibility presets for PlayFKiss and DirectKiss are now provided in the UltraKiss  Options dialog.</strong> These presets set the necessary compatibiity options for each viewer. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">4. A new compatibility option is defined to enable object detachment when restricted objects are dragged to their restriction boundaries. Previously, UltraKiss would always detach such objects and fire detach() events. This option is now turned off by default for DirectKiss compatibility. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">5. GUI components copied and pasted were not retaining attributes on the pasted copy. This problem is corrected. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">6. The transparency value field for the cel and group object transparency adjustments was not being displayed correctly on Linux systems. This problem is corrected.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">7. <strong>A mouse down and mouse up sequence problem that led to image corruption on display has been corrected.</strong> Multiple mouse down and up events could be issued in sequence if both the left and right mouse buttons were pressed concurrently. This violated the inherent assumption that  sequential processing would occur for mouse activities. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">8. A new toolbar toggle button is provided to enable and disable edit selections. This feature is  off by default therefore initially loaded sets will no longer respond to right mouse clicks for edit selection unless the button is activated.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">9. Edit paste of selected objects now provides a visual indication of the paste completion. The selection box flickers momentarily to show that the pasted object overlays the original object. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">10. A restart problem which prevented current active events from firing after the restart has been corrected. The event interruption termination state was not being reset.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">11. Improperly formatted Cel files that contain an invalid image width and height now issue a correct error message on load rather than an Out of Memory fault. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">12.

					<P>UltraKiss V2.1 is released. </P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.1&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. Undo and Redo of imported palettes was not resetting the current selection set. The Import Images to Selection menu option was not always correctly enabled after an Undo or Undo All command.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">2. Import of duplicate or ambiguous GIF images automatically converted to CEL images could display  incorrect colors after a set restart or other palette action occurred. This problem  applied only to ambiguous cels. The original palette could be inconsistent with the newly imported image. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">3. Image offsets on imported images converted to CEL images could be dropped on a set restart if image offsets were maintained in CEL  files.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">4. Label components will now display a background color if the background attribute is set.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">5. <strong>The FKiSS action commands  iffixed() and ifnotfixed() now apply to cels.</strong> The FKiSS specification states that these commands only apply to objects, however PlayFKiss accepted a cel argument. The Scarecrow sets  now behave better.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">6. Undo and Redo of configuration background color changes was not properly restoring the background color for the playfield. This problem is corrected. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">7. <strong>Button and Label  and other non-input component cels may now be saved in CEL format</strong>. This feature provides an easy way to add labels and buttons to your KiSS set and save the set in a form compatible with other viewers. A new Export GUI Components as Cels option  is provided in the Import tab of the UltraKiss options dialog to enable this feature. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">8. Components added to a group object could not be positioned within the group. This problem is corrected. Component cels now behave as other images for offset positioning within group objects.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">9. New Select and Ungroup options are provided on the context sensitive pop-up menu for an object. Right-clicking while over an object shows the pop-up menu and the new  options can now be used to select the object for editing. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">10. An UltraKiss BoxLayout exception that prevented UltraKiss from starting on Java 1.3 has been corrected. This applies to Apple systems.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">11. Cel references to ambiguous cels now return the first ambiguous cel on the current page. Previously, UltraKiss would return the first ambiguous cel in the set. This correction implements contextual reference to such cels so that FKiSS action commands that specify ambiguous cel names will now apply to the visible page.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">12. The UltraKiss preset of objects and cels to FKiSS action commands, a performance feature, may have applied the FKiSS action to the incorrect object. This problem is corrected for ambiguous cels. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">13. <strong>The FKiSS action commands letfix() and setfix() now apply to cels.</strong> Note that setfix() for a cel does not make the parent object 'sticky'. To fix the object, use a setfix() command with an object group number.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">14. Corrections have been made to stabilize the set and page restart behaviour for imported cels converted to CEL format. Previously, such cels could display incorrect background or color maps if the cel duplicated a previous image. </font></P>

					<P>UltraKiss V2.0c is released. </P>
					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.0c&nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. Image transparency may not have been correctly restored on set restarts. This problem is corrected.</font></P>
                      <p>
                        <FONT face=Arial>2. A new menu edit command 'Import Palette'  is implemented to faclitate importing new palette files to the configuration. If this is the first palette file for the configuration, the window background and border color is established if it has not previously been set to an RGB value. </FONT></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">3. <strong>The UltraKiss image scaling system has been redesigned.</strong> Set magnification and reduction now scales the output screen and no longer scales the individual cel images. This improvement significantly reduces the memory requirements when viewing magnified sets.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">4. The UltraKiss Media Player tool is reinstated. The Media Player continues to be an experimental tool. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">5. Corrections have been made to the option maintenance functions to resolve issues with option restores when set specific options were applied. Previously,  option values could be lost between invokations of UltraKiss.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">6. UltraKiss sets now open inside the current window. Previously, new sets would expand the window to the maximum screen size. To maintain prior behaviour a new window  option is provided to enable opening sets at the maximum screen size. Also, a new Window option tab has been introduced in the UltraKiss options dialog to manage window  options.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">7. UltraKiss tool windows now open on top of the main UltraKiss window when the Tutorial help system is active. This facilitates viewing of tutorial instructions concurrently with  the UltraKiss tools. The main UltraKiss window is restored to its prior size when the Tutorial system is closed.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">8. The UltraKiss directory Search facility is corrected to no longer display the UltraKiss splash screen when the search tool  terminates.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">9.<strong> Imported images are now automatically converted to Cel images during import.</strong> A new option to enable or disable this conversion is provided on the UltraKiss Import options dialog. This option is set by default, therefore all GIF, JPG, PNG, BMP, and PPM images imported into a new KiSS set are automatically converted to CEL images with the appropriate palette KCF file, if applicable.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">10. Previously, images that had palette changes may not have been displayed. This problem was not know to occur, but it has been corrected by ensuring that all filtered images are fully loaded before use.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">11. Palette files associated with Imported images were not being shown in the active configuration list. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">12. A new Window option is defined to enable and disable the display of the playfield boarder. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">13. Changes to the configuration playfield size could display scaled images. This problem has been corrected. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">14. <strong>Sound files did not always play  with Java 1.5</strong>. Resetting the sound file position to the start of the file did not work reliably. The problem is corrected by opening sound files on each playback rather than resetting the sound file position. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">15. All UltraKiss dialogs are now positioned to the center of the parent window, rather than the center of the screen.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">16. The Text Editor Find and Replace functions now restart the search from the beginning of the file if the requested item cannot be found. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">17. The file update state could be lost when edit changes were made to KiSS sets loaded from a file directory, rather than from an archive file. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">18. Setting a new multipalette for a page set through the page set properties dialog would not accept values that exceeded the number of multipalettes in the first palette file. This problem is corrected.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">19. A new Read Me menu option is implemented to directly view the UltraKiss release notes in the program installation directory. Instructions for increasing the available memory pool size are now readily available.</font></p>

					<h3><FONT face=Arial>Updates to V2.0b&nbsp; &nbsp; </FONT></h3>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. <strong>Collision event processing is corrected for FKiSS 4 recognition of group objects, cels, and cel groups</strong>. Previously, UltraKiss was not correctly identifying the event action objects that applied to statements with mixed object groups, cels, and cel groups. This could cause collision events not to fire. UltraKiss is now compatible with DirectKiss.</FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>2.Collision events applied through move action statements are now coordinated with FKiSS collisions applied through mouse release actions. Previously, UltraKiss would duplicately fire the same collision event twice - once from the move and once from the mouse release. </FONT></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">3. Collision initial state was not always being set correctly for movement commands that applied to cels. The cel was being repositioned first within the object before initial collision states were established. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">4.Collision event firing sequence (collide, apart, in, stillin, out, stillout) and mouse movement event firing sequence (press, catch, fixcatch, collide, apart, in, stillin, out, stillout, release, drop, fixdrop) are specified to retain consistency with DirectKiss. Note that UltraKiss events can be asynchronous activities. To enforce this synchronous firing sequence only one event handler should be configured. See Options-FKiSS-Event handlers. </font></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>5. The FKiSS Event Wizard is enhanced to show the primary event object name in the dialog title. </FONT></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">6. Events created with the Event Wizard are no longer double spaced when written to the active CNF file. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">7. <strong>The Event Wizard now generates Snap-To events for cels</strong>. When cels collide  Snap-To moves the parent group object. Cel collision enables more accurate collision detection for Snap-To items. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">8. DirectKiss %x and %y tags are now maintained in the active CNF if the configuration is recognized as a DirectKiss file. Previously UltraKiss would convert these cel offset tags to UltraKiss %offset[x,y] tags.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">9. FKiSS event and action parameter lists could parse incorrectly if  spaces occurred before the list comma delimiter or the closing parenthesis. </font></P>

			  <BLOCKQUOTE>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. Pause breakpoints would  not fire on mouse initiated events if the FKiSS editor had not previously been opened. This problem is corrected by transitioning the event activity to an independent thread if pause breakpoints have been activated. </FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>2. <strong>A new Event Wizard is implemented</strong>. This wizard can automatically construct Snap To events, press, release, in, out, catch, drop, stillin, stillout, fixcatch, fixdrop, and unfix events on objects or cels. The wizard can be accessed from the object context menus by right-clicking when the mouse is over an object. </FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>3. A wait cursor is now displayed on loading Tips messages. Slow load times have been observed on some systems with applets.</FONT></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">4. GUI components can now be saved as images with the Image Editor. This saves an image representation of the component as a cherry KiSS cel or other image type.</font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">5. <strong>New tutorials are provided</strong> to show how to convert and manipulate images and image palettes and to use the Event Wizard to create and edit FKiSS events. These tutorials are packaged with the UltraKiss extensions. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">6. Imported cel images could be dropped from display on set restarts if images were not cached in memory and the set had not been saved. </font></P>
                      <P><font face="Arial">7. Changes are made to correct a problem where multiple tutorial help screens could be launched on a Tutorial request. </font></P>

                      <P><FONT face=Arial>1. Corrections are made to verify operation on Java 1.3, for Mac OS X use.</FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>2. Corrections are made to verify the Search module operation, for searching URLs on the World Wide Web.</FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>3. New File-Open and File-Search menu commands are provided for the UltraKiss Portal to facilitate opening HTML index files constructed by the new Search module. </FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>4. A set restart problem that assumed sets with INCLUDE files were restartable has been resolved.</FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>5. A configuration 'file not found' error could be experienced after importing an image and saving the set. This fault is corrected.</FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>6. <strong>A new menu command 'Save As Files' </strong>is provided to automatically extract all elements of a KiSS configuration from a compressed archive and write the files to a directory. This command easily extracts a KiSS set from an LZH or ZIP archive.</FONT></P>
                      <P><FONT face=Arial>7. PNG files when saved as PNG were not correctly maintaining alpha transparency. </FONT></P>

						  occur during class loads of library classes that did not exist.&nbsp;</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. <strong>New Custom option settings have been defined to adjust standard UltraKiss 
								directory paths.</strong>&nbsp; These options can be found in the&nbsp; Tools - Options

					  <p><font face="Arial">6. UltraKiss will now display background images on the idle screen.&nbsp; 
						Background images must be of the form 'name1.ext', 'name2.ext', ...,

						  n times, with variable v being set to the iteration count beginning from 1.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. <strong>The DirectKiss  'savevalue', 'loadvalue', 'deletevalue', and 'valuepool'

						  retained across set loads.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. Mac OS X image distortion could occur when image size exceeded the right and 
								lower frame bounds.&nbsp; This is a video driver fault with hardware

					  <p><font face="Arial">14. UltraKiss will now display animated icon images.&nbsp; Animated icon images 
								must be of the form 'name1.ext', 'name2.ext', ..., 'nameN.ext' and all stored 
								in the same directory.&nbsp; Small icon images of 16x16 pixels must be of the

					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 5b) update</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. The Color Editor tool can now dither an image to the specified number of

					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 5a)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. The syntax for most GUI component modifier commands has been changed to 
								reflect a consistent parameter order.&nbsp; Accessor functions are of the form 
								'getXXX(return_value, component)'.&nbsp; Modifier functions are of the form 
								'setXXX(component, value)'.&nbsp; This change is implemented to maintain

					  <p><font face="Arial">2. <strong>HTML file types can now be edited and displayed with the UltraKiss 
						  Editor.</strong>&nbsp; HTML version 3.2 syntax is supported.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. <strong>FKiSS label() commands are extended to accept local parameters and return a

					  <p><font face="Arial">4. A hang problem related to drawing non-input GUI components has been resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. New environment() commands are implemented to support date calculations and 
								date formatting.&nbsp; The environment() command is structured to enable access

					  <p><font face="Arial">6. New viewer() commands are implemented to enable substitution of&nbsp; the

					<p>UltraKiss V1.0 (beta 5) has been released with new features to define and use

					<p>Our KiSS catalogue service has been terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 5)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. Print and network support menu commands are now disabled if UltraKiss is 
								running as a secure applet or as a secure application. Previously, these 
						  commands were available but would generate a Security Exception when used.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. LHA file compression now supports -lh6- and -lh7- compression modes.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. UltraKiss will now correctly interpret cel configuration line page 
								declarations for older KiSS files that did not contain spaces between each page 
								entry. Page numbers that have multiple digits for non-UltraKiss specific 
								configuration files will be recognized as individual page specifiers based upon 
						  each digit in the number.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. Print preview has been enhanced to enable printing of a specific preview 
								page. Clicking on a preview image shows the page at full size, whereupon it can 
						  be printed.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Cel images, if duplicates of other cels in the configuration, could be 
								written to an archive file on a file save operation with 0 length. This could 
								create an archive file that would not reload correctly. This condition was 
								observed when sets with duplicate cels were loaded as URL entries and 
						  subsequently saved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. Set restarts could intermittently fail due to a duplicate hash code being 
								returned for state changes on different objects. This problem is resolved by 
						  defining a different, unique object key.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. Set downloads from the UltraKiss browser now prompt to inquire if the set 
						  should be saved or opened in UltraKiss.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. The UltraKiss browser tool now provides new back and forward functions to 
								traverse previously viewed web pages. A new refresh function can also be used 
						  to restore the current page.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. <strong>A problem interpreting nested FKiSS constructs with multiple elseif() 
								statements has been corrected.</strong> Statements of the form if() ... elseif() ... 
								elseif() ... else() ... endif() could fail. Logic skip states were not 
						  correctly managed for elseif() statements.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. Multiple Notify dialogs issued within the same FKiSS event would reference 
						  only the last message text. This problem has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. The MediaPlayer could hang switching to new playlist entries when running 
						  with a Java 1.4.1 virtual machine. This issue has been resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. <strong>Local FKiSS variables can now be specified within Label events.</strong> Selective 
								use of local variables provides support for recursive label calls. Local 
								variables are preceded with an '@' character and are created with let() 
								statements. For example, a local variable declaration statement is 
						  'let(@Row,10)'.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. When specific elements were saved to an archive, directory path information 
								could be lost. Archive output will now retain prior directory paths for 
						  previous archive elements.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. A new UltraKiss FKiSS 5 'viewer' command is available. The syntax is 
								'viewer("command",arg1,arg2,...)'. The viewer() command is used to invoke 
								UltraKiss specific viewer control functions. Commands currently implemented are 
						"reset", to automatically reset all current object positions; "restart", to 
								restart the set and reinitialize all events; "select", to show a standard 
								configuration selection dialog; "open", to automatically open the named file 
								specified in arg1; and "option", to set the UltraKiss program option named in 
						  arg1 to the value specified in arg2.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. The letkcf() command is extended to return the ordinal palette number in use 
								for cel groups and object groups. Previously, letkcf() only applied to image 
								cels. If image cels in the specified cel group or object group do not all 
						  consistently reference the same ordinal palette file, then letkcf() returns -1.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. <strong>The in(), out(), stillin() and stillout() events are extended to apply to 
								cel groups and named image cels.</strong> Previously these events only applied to object 
						  groups.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. A problem with incorrect object positioning when objects were moved to 
								satisfy new restrictx() and restricty() boundaries has been corrected. Objects 
								were incorrectly positioned based upon their visible location and not the 
						  object location.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">18. Corrections were made to the Event Handler routines to reduce the occurrence 
						  of Event termination timeout errors.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">19. <strong>UltraKiss now loads into memory only the images necessary to display the 
								current page set.</strong> Images are unloaded when the page set changes. This can 
								significantly reduce the operating memory requirements for some KiSS sets. The 
								UltraKiss option 'Cache Images', if set, will force a load of all images at set 
						  initialization.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">20. Word wrap is now implemented for rich text files.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">21. Corrections have been made to the Print Preview routines to properly 
						  calculate page boundaries for rich text files.&nbsp;</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">22. <strong>UltraKiss now supports interactive Labels, Buttons, Check Boxes, Radio 
								Buttons, Text Boxes, Text Fields, multi-line scrollable Text Areas, scrollable 
								Lists and Combo Boxes within KiSS sets</strong>. These basic Graphical User Interface 
								(GUI) components are fully functional cels that provide simplified capability 
								for user input and output. Specific attributes can be defined for each GUI 
								component to set characteristics such as text font types, size, component 
								background and foreground colors, scrolling characteristics, and input 
								capabilities. New FKiSS 5 UltraKiss commands are implemented to support setting 
								and retrieving of component values. Component input events can be recognized 
						  with the standard FKiSS press() and release() event model.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">23. UltraKiss now provides new FKiSS 5 commands to open(), read(), write(), and 
								close() external files. These commands can be used to create persistent storage 
						  for KiSS sets.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">24. Corrections have been made to improve the display of a wait cursor. 
								Previously, the wait cursor would not show or could be delayed, resulting in

								application is always available anytime you want -- either from an icon on your 
								desktop or from the browser link.&nbsp; Java Web Start also ensures that the 
								most current version of the application is always presented to you.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						Because Java Web Start runs independently of any browser, you can shut down 
						your browser and continue to use UltraKiss. Applications deployed with Java Web 
						Start do not require a browser to operate. You can start UltraKiss anytime from 
						the desktop icon, without starting your browser again.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. If UltraKiss was installed with the standard installer it is limited to the 
								default Java memory pool size of 64MB.&nbsp; Java Web Start installations do 
								not have this limitation.&nbsp; If you experience 'Out of Memory' errors or 
								program hangs with a standard installation, the UltraKiss run time memory pool 
								size can be increased by manually editing the installed program control 
								file.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						In the UltraKiss <b>program installation directory</b> edit the file <b>UltraKiss.lax
								</b>using any text editor program.&nbsp; Add the following line to the end of 
								the file.&nbsp; This line requests a 200MB memory pool.&nbsp;<br>

					  <p><font face="Arial">3. Hiragana and Kanji Japanese characters found in Shift-JIS encoded KiSS sets 
								from Japan can be interpreted by UltraKiss if appropriate Japanese fonts are 
								installed on your computer and you are using the Internationalized Java run 
								time system.&nbsp; [Note, an internationalized Java system is now automatically 
								installed if UltraKiss is downloaded with a Java VM.]<br>
						<br>
						If you are a <b>Unix/Linux</b> person all you must do is ensure that a Japanese 
								font file has been installed in the correct directory ( <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc</tt>). 
								Recent releases of Linux come with this included.<br>
						<br>
						For <b>Windows</b> users, the best method is to ensure that a Japanese 
								True-Type Font (ttf) has been installed on your system.&nbsp; The Monash ftp 
								archive has two Microsoft Japanese fonts available: <a href="ftp://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/ie3lpkja.exe">
									Gothic</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/JpnSupp.exe">Mincho</a>. 
								These are both self-installing executable files.<br>
						<br>
						In the Java run time system (look in the jre/lib subdirectory in the UltraKiss 
						program installation directory), replace the existing font. properties file 
						with the font.properties.ja file.&nbsp; This is most easily done by renaming 
								font.properties.ja to be font.properties<br>
						<br>
						Within UltraKiss, use Tools-Options and select the Japanese language setting on 
						the main option screen.&nbsp; If you load or edit KiSS sets with SJIS 
						  encodings, Japanese characters can now be seen.&nbsp;</font></p>

					<p>We have released&nbsp; UltraKiss (beta 4).&nbsp; This is a stability update for 
						object collisions and is the first release of the Image Editor tool with 
						support for GIF 89a file editing.&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 4)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. Ambiguous (copied) GIF images were not properly duplicating the internal GIF 
								image frames. This was causing offset problems and positioning problems. This 
						  is now fixed.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. Cel Group specifiers may now be coded on comment lines that follow the cel 
						  definition in the KiSS configuration file.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. Image selection could select images with background transparent pixels. Cel 
								image transparent colors were not always consistent with the palette 
						  transparent color.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. Formatting changes are made to the UltraKiss generated CNF file to not write 
								(default) "*" palette specifiers or ":" cel page specifiers if these fields did 
						  not exist in the original input file.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. RestrictAttach behaviour has been revised to now automatically detach fixed 
								objects if a new restriction creates an unsatisfiable restriction set for the 
						  attached object chain.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. A new CelGroupFrames.lzh test set is available on Kisekae World to exercise 
						  various options for frame specifications with and without the colon ":" specifier.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. A drawing problem that could leave artifacts on the screen if scaled images 
						  were used has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Scaling of image cels was not correctly applying the adjusted colors if the 
						  images were using a modified color model. This has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. The Adjust Layering dialog now includes an active preview window to visually 
								observe the effect of layering changes. Image cel layers may now be changed by 
						  entering numeric values.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. The animate() command has been extended to enable Gif animation for image 
								cels contained within object groups or cel groups. A new GifAnimate.lzh test 
								set is available on Kisekae World to exercise various options for enabling and 
						  disabling cel animation.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. The bundled install of UltraKiss now copies a Midi soundbank to the Java run 
								time system. This corrects problems with Midi playback. Java systems require a 
								soundbank.gm file in the jre/lib/audio directory. If a soundbank does not exist 
						  Midi files may not play or may sound distorted.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. The UltraKiss About dialog contains a new build date field to show the 
						  current software release date.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. The mediaplayer(), music() and sound() interaction has been qualified. A new 
								SoundTest.lzh test set is available on Kisekae World to exercise various 
						  options for testing sound actions.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. FKiSS generic set() and col() events are now implemented. Set() and col() 
								events that do not specify a parameter will fire on every page set or color set 
						  change that does not have a specific page or color set event registered.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. Print support, including print preview is now implemented. Memory 
						  requirements to display preview images have been reduced.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. Collision events now fire when object visibility changes. Collision 
								detection is implemented for map(), unmap(), altmap() and page set 
								changes.&nbsp; A new compatibility option exists in the Option dialog to 
						  disable this feature.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. The setpal() action command is now implemented. This command sets a fixed 
								palette group association for a specific cel or all cels within the specified 
								object or cel group. This change has also extended the letpal() command to 
								accept an optional cel name parameter. The new letpal() command can now return 
						  the current palette group associated with the named image cel.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">18. Memory requirements for non-animated GIF images [GIF images with only one 
								frame] have been reduced. KiSS sets that use non-animated GIF images now 
						  require less memory to load and run.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">19. The Image Editor tool can now be used to update and modify animated GIF 
								images. GIF frame palettes, animation parameters, and control parameters can 
						  now be adjusted.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">20. FKiSS Collision events will now fire only when the primary scheduling FKiSS 
								event completes. Collisions will be recognized based upon the initial and final 
								object state at first and last reference. Previously, moves or visibility 
								changes applied to the same object within the same event would fire collision 
								events after each action. This could result in interim collision events being 
						  executed during multiple object moves or visibility changes.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">21. Object mouse control will now be released on an FKiSS changeset() command if 
								a new page set is displayed. The mouse controlled object is dropped on the 
								prior page. Mouse control is not released on a request to change to the current 
						  page.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">22. Collision events were returning a no-collision state for objects not on the 
								current page set. This was not correct. An invalid collision state is required 
						  to differentiate from a valid, no collision state.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">23. Bounding box collision events were not checking for object visibility. This 
						  is corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">24. UltraKiss will now display a temporary splash window while UltraKiss is 
						  loading.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">25. Release 1.0 (beta 4) will expire on March 31, 2003.</font></p>

					<p><b>November 5, 2002</b></p>
					<p>We have released&nbsp; UltraKiss (beta 3c).&nbsp; This is a stability update for 
						object attachments, restrictions, and collisions.&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 3c)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. FKiSS restrictx() and restricty() action statements now detach unfixed 
								objects from their parent object if the restriction moves the object and the 
						  object is not glued.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. Alarms are now re-initialized on a KiSS set restart operation.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. Color filters now limit pixel alpha transparency changes to the maximum 
								opaqueness of the original image pixel. Previously, UltraKiss would apply the 
								same alpha transparency to all pixels and thus invalidate any specific 
						  transparency effects set in truecolor images.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. A warning confirmation dialog will now be displayed for UltraKiss option 
						  changes that require a KiSS set restart.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. UltraKiss stillin() and stillout() event processing has been corrected to 
								recognize the event regardless of the initial object collision state. 
								Previously, UltraKiss would only trigger the event when the collision state was 
						  unchanged as a result of a move.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. The default behaviour for the transparent() command has been adjusted to 
								bound object transparency changes to the range 0-255. This provides FKiSS 
								compatibility for code that assumed a transparent(X,-255) followed by a 
								transparent(X,n) would yield a known transparency of 'n' for all images in the 
						  object.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. FKiSS moves of attached objects were computing moves relative to the total 
								combined object location. Attached objects were not always positioned correctly 
						  after a moveto() command.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. The FKiSS 4 lettimer(var,alarm) command is implemented. This command returns 
								the time remaining before the indicated alarm fires, or 0 if the alarm is 
						  inactive.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. A new [Option Section] is now written to UltraKiss configuration files if any 
								UltraKiss options have been changed from their default values. UltraKiss 
						  options are now automatically set to these values when the KiSS set is loaded.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. FKiSS collision events apart(), collide(), in(), out(), stillin() and 
								stillout() will now recognize collision events for all attached objects. 
								Previously, collision events were only recognized for the primary selected 
						  object.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. The UltraKiss main window will now retain a maximized or adjusted window 
								size when new KiSS sets are loaded. Previously, UltraKiss would reset the main 
						  window to its default size.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. Attached objects with a non-zero lock value, if selected with the mouse and 
								dragged or FKiSS moved, will now move the consolidated object chain if a parent 
								object exists and is unfixed. Sticky lock counts for the selected object are 
								reduced as expected. This behaviour satisfies the intuitive expectation that if 
								any object in a fixed attachment chain is selected, the complete mobile part of 
						  the attachment set is moved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. UltraKiss will now accept two run time command line options. The first 
								option specifies the file name for a KiSS set to be loaded on program 
								initiation. The second option specifies an initial default directory name for 
								file open requests. Each option can specify a relative or fully qualified path 
								name. For relative names, file names are relative to the default file open 
								directory. Directory names are relative to the default user home directory. 
								File or directory names that contain spaces must be enclosed in quotation 
						  marks.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. If the UltraKiss playfield was scaled image cels were being saved at the 
						  scaled size.&nbsp; Images are now written at their original size.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. Images imported into a non-archive KiSS set that referenced an existing 
								palette file could insert duplicated %palette entries into the CNF file. This 
						  problem has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. Edit selecting, copying and pasting ungrouped image cels now properly create 
						  new cels for pasted objects.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. The unfix() event interpretation has been modified.&nbsp; Unfix was 
								specified to fire on an object transition from fixed to unfixed. However, 
								unfix() must fire at some later time when the object is next touched with the 
								mouse. With this interpretation unfix() becomes a pending mouse event and not a 
						  state transition event.</font></p>

					<p>We have released&nbsp; UltraKiss (beta 3b).&nbsp; This update corrects many 
						problems with visual editing, cut/paste and image imports.&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 3b)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. FKiSS action statements letinitx() and letinity() are corrected to return 
								initial object locations on the current page. These commands were previously 
						  returning zero values.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. A program hang could occur if asynchronous changecol() or changeset() actions 
								were issued while objects were being dragged or otherwise manipulated on the 
						  screen. This has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. FKiSS cel group specifications will now parse definitions that fail to 
						  contain a leading space before the ':' frame list specifier.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. The expansion set ;INCLUDE configuration statement is now implemented. This 
								statement lists the necessary base configuration files required by the 
						  expansion set.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Expansion set loads can now retain event definitions from the base set. 
								Expansion sets may create new events or redefine existing events. A new 
								compatibility option has been implemented to retain base events during 
						  expansion set loads so that expansion sets need only define new events.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. Many corrections have been made to UltraKiss edit functions to eliminate 
								errors with Edit cut, paste, undo, redo, and the creation of new objects from 
						  ungrouped or grouped selections.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. UltraKiss was not applying relative transparency changes to object image cels 
								if the object transparency fell outside a 0-255 transparency limit. This has 
						  been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Cloned object are now correctly positioned to the source object location.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. UltraKiss can now maintain unique %offset[] tags for GIF images and CEL 
								images that are repositioned on a page with the UltraKiss editing functions. 
								Previously, UltraKiss would save the image offsets within the GIF or CEL image 
								file. This could cause compatibility problems if the file was duplicated in the 
						  KiSS set or used by external programs.&nbsp;</font></p>

						implementation of direct visual editing for ungrouped objects and implements 
						object movement restrictions for&nbsp; attached objects.&nbsp; This update also 
						introduces a new compatibility feature to automatically correct KiSS 
						configuration files with missing statements on if-else-endif 
						sequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 3a)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. Property dialogs will now disable the FKiSS Event button if an active 
						  configuration is not loaded.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. An FKiSS syntax error could occur if the FKiSS command prefix ';@' was 
						  immediately followed by a comment semicolon. This has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. A new compatibility feature will now automatically correct KiSS configuration 
								files with incomplete if-else-endif block structure and incorrect action 
								command names.&nbsp; UltraKiss will now compensate for such code and insert 
								missing block termination statements and proper FKiSS command names where 
								possible. UltraKiss can write backwards compatible configuration files if a 
						  corrected configuration is saved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. More rigorous syntax checking is now performed if the compatibility feature 
								is disabled or an UltraKiss configuration file is recognized. Strict syntax 
								checking will report FKiSS syntax errors for incorrectly nested if-else-endif 
						  blocks, invalid loop statements, and unrecognized command names.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. GIF and BMP palette images saved in KiSS CEL format now correctly translate 
						  non-zero transparency indexes to KCF palette color index 0.&nbsp;</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. The FKiSS Editor will now step into gosub() routines called from a label 
						  block entered through a goto() command.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. Changes to Integer variable values within the FKiSS Editor will now be 
								interpreted by FKiSS action commands as integer values. The FKiSS Editor was 
						  incorrectly converting Integer variables to String values.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Corrections have been made to the UltraKiss editing features to complete the 
								implementation of cut, paste, and movement of ungrouped objects. This enables 
								direct manipulation of component image cels within object groups. Ungrouped 
								cels can now be correctly repositioned within the object, cut from the object, 
								or pasted back into their original ungrouped object. All edit operations are 
						  fully undoable.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. Indirect variable names prefixed with the '$' indirection symbol were not 
								created as upper case variables when case sensitive variable names were 
						  disabled. This has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. FKiSS if-elseif-else-endif sequences failed to properly handle the else() 
						  condition when used after an elseif command. This has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. Cels with transparent pixels can now be automatically selected by the mouse 
								unless the cel is unmapped or ghosted or the pixel is the cel transparent 
						  color.&nbsp;</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. UltraKiss will now display color set selection buttons for all palette group 
								defined in all palette files in the configuration. Previously, UltraKiss would 
								only display selection buttons for the palette groups defined in the first 
						  palette file.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. Objects with movement restrictions set through the restrictx() and

						  restriction bounds.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. The object group and image cel properties dialogs now show correct object 
						  locations based upon the selected page set context.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. FKiSS action statements letheight() and letwidth() have been adjusted to

					  <p><font face="Arial">4. Object transparencies set with the transparent() command now ensure the 
								object transparency is restricted to values from 0 to 255. Prior to this change 
						  it was possible to set object transparencies greater than 255 or less than 0.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Dragging images beneath other transparent images would show the dragged image 
								transparent background. This problem has been corrected by recomposing the 
						  scene from the bottom up.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. FKiSS changecol() commands are no longer restricted to the color sets as 
								defined in the first palette file. A changecol command will now change object 
						  colors to palette groups defined in an object specific palette.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. A bug that prevented the clearing of Color Editor selected colors, introduced 
						  in the beta 2 release, has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. All sound files, except for MP3 audio, are now processed with Java Sound. 
								Prior to this change only MIDI files were processed with Java Sound if Java 
						  Media Framework was installed.</font></p>

					<p><strong>August 5, 2002</strong></p>
					<p>This is the second beta release of the Kisekae UltraKiss application.</p>
					<p>UltraKiss V1.0 (beta 2) has many stability fixes and has introduced following 
						new features:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">UltraKiss is now bundled with Java 1.4.0 run time 
								environment.&nbsp; Java 1.4 supports video hardware acceleration for 
								significant performance gains.&nbsp; Initial results show that UltraKiss CPU 
								requirements can be reduced by more than 50% for graphic intensive KiSS sets.<br>
							</font>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">UltraKiss now retains all CNF configuration file 
								comments and unparsed lines within the active configuration file.&nbsp; You can 
								easily edit your configuration file, apply the changes, and reload the KiSS set 
								to test new content.<br>
							</font>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">UltraKiss property dialogs now provide a graphic user 
								interface to change selected object attributes such as object position, 
								transparency, lock value and visibility.&nbsp; The configuration screen size 
								and border color can also be set through the graphical interface.<br>
							</font>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">Two new tutorials in the Help system provide 
								instructive examples on using UltraKiss to create new KiSS sets, introduce 
								animation, and add multimedia effects.&nbsp;<br>
							</font>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">A new KiSS game demonstrating the power of the 
								UltraKiss FKiSS5 is provided with the beta 2 release.&nbsp; Have fun with 
								Hashira, a Japanese version of Tetris, and Slider, a sliding tile game that 
								implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
							</font>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">UltraKiss now contains new settings within the 
								Tools-Options menu to maintain&nbsp; backward compatibility with older viewers.<br>
							</font>
						<li>
							<font face="Arial">UltraKiss now implements the windowsize() and 
								viewport() FKiSS commands.</font></li>
					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta 2)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. A bug that assigned palette attributes to Cherry Kiss image cels that were 
						  duplicated within the configuration has been resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. Palette CEL format image encoding now assigns pixel index zero to any image 
								pixel that is fully transparent. CEL images, if saved, could lose transparency 
						  if the transparent color was not unique or duplicated within the palette.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. Corrected a bug that caused an extraneous parenthesis or spaces to be written 
						  on data set configuration lines if a user comment existed on the line.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. Corrected an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception that could occur loading 
						  animated GIFs with frame disposal code 2 and negative image offset values.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Adjusted the configuration cel line formatted output to retain user spacing 
								for all cel page set definitions and cel line comment text.&nbsp; Format 
								improvements have been made to the Cel Section of the configuration file to 
						  implement consistent spacing.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. Catch() and drop() events are now implemented on all mouse down/up sequences 
								for every object that is not a maximum fixed object. Prior to this change 
								catch() and drop() were implemented only for movable objects with a lock value 
								of 0. A new compatibility option has been&nbsp; introduced to restore the 
								previous interpretation where catch()/drop()&nbsp; and fixcatch()/fixdrop() 
						  were considered to be mutually exclusive.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. Palette group col() events now fire when a changeset() or manual palette 
								group change is initiated for the current palette group. Prior to this change 
						  col() events were fired only if the palette group changed to a different group.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Truecolor image transparency adjustments now apply only to pixels that were 
						  not fully transparent in the original image.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. Object movement through mouse drags can now be disabled if the object under 
								the mouse was moved through a move() action commmand during the mouse down and 
								mouse up sequence. A new compatibility option setting implements this 
								behaviour. This new behaviour supports&nbsp; the intuitive expectation that if 
								an object is touched and moves away, all further movement control should be 
						  lost.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. A problem that resulted in a null input stream error appearing on a cel 
						  image reload or data set restart has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. Formatted configuration file text generation now retains user text that 
								could not be successfully parsed on input. Prior to this change improper CNF 
						  syntax could drop user text from the file.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. Performance enhancement have been made to the event processing logic.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. Implemented nested for-next loop processing.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. Implemented a graphical interface to support selected attribute changes in 
								KiSS object property dialogs. Image cel and object group transparency, offset 
								and location can now be set. Object Lock values can be changed. Configuration 
						  playfield size and border color can be set.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. Corrected a memory leak that would occur with the transparent() action 
								command if transparency changes were attempted using values outside the range 0 
						  to 255.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. Implemented new FKiSS 5 UltraKiss extension action commands clone(), 
								destroy(), letlevel(), setlevel(), indexof() and replacestr(). These commands 
								enable FKiSS creation and destruction of KiSS object groups, adjustment of 
						  object drawing levels and support new string processing functions.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. Implemented FKiSS 5 extensions to letframe() and setframe() action commands 
								to implement a default cel group association for KiSS object groups. Each KiSS 
						  object is considered to be a cel group for individual frame mapping.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">18. FKiSS action commands windowsize() and viewport() are now fully implemented 
						  to use relative offset adjustments.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">19. Release 1.0 (beta 2) will expire on November 30, 2002.</font></p>

					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V1.0 (beta)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. Version numbering has been reset to version 1.0 in preparation for official 
						  product release.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. The unfix() event now fires when the transition from a fixed lock value to an 
								unfixed lock value occurs. The event can be fired on mouse actions and setfix() 
								action commands. The object retains its initial fix state throughout the 
						  transition.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. UltraKiss now tries to recover from stack overflow errors if FKiSS events 
						  exceed available stack space.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. Object collision detection now detect collisions between image cel copies.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Object collision events now fire only if the object was moved.&nbsp; This 
						  requires a non-zero displacement from the initial object position.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. A hang problem experienced with palette cycling color changes has been 
						  resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. A performance problem with slow image repaint after many palette color 
						  changes or transparency changes has been resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. All FKiSS commands, including move(), changeset() and so on can be used in 
								the initialize() event. Timer actions are processed so initial alarm states can 
								be set during initialization. UltraKiss will open to page set 0 by default 
								unless the opening page was explicitly specified through a changeset() action 
						  command.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. A logic error recognizing and firing stillout() events has been corrected.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. UltraKiss will not decrement sticky object lock values if&nbsp; a setfix() 
								action dynamically changes the lock value&nbsp; between a mouse down and mouse 
						  up sequence.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. Duplicate [Cel Section] heading lines in the UltraKiss configuration file 
								have been removed.&nbsp; This problem could occur&nbsp; if image cel layering 
						  was changed</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. A problem encoding 16 color 4-bit cel files that could result in slanted cel 
						  images has been resolved.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. The Color Editor will now save truecolor images as different image types.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. A Maximum Fixed Object value has been added to the Options-KiSS 
								configuration settings to specify the maximum object lock value.&nbsp; Objects 
								whose lock values equal or exceed this setting will not generate catch(), 
						  fixcatch(), drop() or fixdrop() events.&nbsp;</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. An option to recognize and select objects with fully transparent pixels has 
								been added to the Options-General tab.&nbsp; If this option is set objects can 
								be picked up and moved by their transparent pixels and FKiSS&nbsp; mouse 
						  related events will be recognized for fully transparent objects.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. Edit selected ghost cels can now be moved within the edit subsystem.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. UltraKiss will now report a syntax error for&nbsp; invalid numeric 
						  parameters coded in FKiSS event and action statements.&nbsp;</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">18. Release 1.0 (beta) will expire on August 31, 2002.</font></p>

					<p>Kisekae UltraKiss alpha release 3.8</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V3.8 (alpha)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. The UltraKiss keyboard event and action statements keytype, letkeystring, and 
						  letkeymodifier are now implemented.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. Corrected a PG-UP and PG-DN system hang when all pages of the dataset were 
						  empty.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. Modified the CNF write function to write section headers only if objects 
						  actually exist in the relevant section.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. Corrected a bug where a GIF transparent color index was not being written 
						  after being initially set with the color editor.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. Eliminated the closing prompt to write updated page sets when edits such as 
								cuts, pastes, and image imports have been performed. New object positions for 
								all objects created during editing are now automatically set when the 
						  configuration is closed or the page positions are explicitly written.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. Corrected a bug where configuration cel lines were being written when cels 
						  had been cut or removed from a configuration.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. Implemented numerous corrections to cut/paste processing, file save and 
						  restart operations that lead to inconsistent operations or other failures.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. Implemented the web interface to start the default web browser from within 
								applications. This interface was previously available but only if UltraKiss was 
								running in an applet context. The File-Open Web command starts a web browser 
						  application.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. Implemented a new File-Open URL command to download files into UltraKiss from 
						  the Internet.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. The online Help documentation is now released. All help files except for the 
								Text Editor, Image Editor and Tutorials are complete. The Help system supports

					<p>Kisekae UltraKiss alpha release 3.7</p>
					<h3><font face="Arial">Changes in V3.7 (alpha)</font></h3>
			  <blockquote>
					  <p><font face="Arial">1. A (timing) bug in the data set loader that would occasionally cause a 
								successful load to not activate has been fixed. This problem showed up under 
						  Linux.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">2. Many dialog window sizes have been expanded to fit large font text without 
						  truncation. Large fonts are used as the default look and feel in Linux.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">3. The memory copy of the configuration file is now automatically updated if the 
								active configuration file is saved within the Text Editor. This ensures that a 
								restart or save of the data set will access the revised copy of the 
						  configuration.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">4. A bug has been corrected that stopped movement of ungrouped image cels into 
						  the upper left corner of the playfield when the 'limit move' option was set.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">5. The Color Editor will now import KCF files as well as PAL files. The import 
								operation replaces the current palette contents with the imported file 
						  contents.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">6. A bug has been fixed that prevented sound from terminating on a sound("") or 
						  music("") statement, or through the master sound switch.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">7. Changes have been made to standardize FKiSS terminology throughout the 
								program. Version 3.6 failed to update all occurrences. The PAL text format now 
						  uses standard terms.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">8. A new 'Adjust Layering' feature has been implemented to enable z-order 
								positioning of image cels. Cels can now be layered by dragging and dropping the 
								line item within an ordered list of image cels. This is a new undoable 
						  operation within the edit subsystem.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">9. The left click and right click editing drag operations have been adjusted to 
								implement a standard user interface. Alt-left click drags select objects for 
								adding to the selection set. Alt-right click drags select objects for removing 
								from the selection set. When a selection set exists, ctrl-left click adds an 
						  object and ctrl-right click removes an object.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. The cel configuration line syntax has been extended to allow the 
								specification of a specific palette group for a cel. A new cel palette syntax 
								example is *0.15 and this forces the cel to use palette group 15 from palette 
								number 0. Kiss cels with fixed palette groups specified in this way, or GIF 
								cels or BMP cels that contain fixed palettes, or truecolor images such as JPG 
								or PPM or Cherry Kiss cels will not change their palette through changecol() 
						  actions or other KiSS color set changes.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. A 'New Group' edit operation has been implemented to group all selected 
								objects into one new object group. This edit is undoable. This feature applies 
								to selected object groups or ungrouped image cels. It extends the edit 
								subsystem to facilitate the creation of new object groups by consolidating 
								currently selected object groups or ungrouped image cels into a new object 
						  group.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">12. The Archive Manager will now dispay a security violation message if an 
								attempt is made to open an archive file and UltraKiss does not have access 
						  rights to the local filesystem.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. Edit cut and paste of ungrouped image cels has been improved. Prior to 
								version 3.7 selection, cut and paste of ungrouped objects was not possible. 
								Undo operations for imported image cels now function correctly. Ungrouped image 
								cels can be copied, cut from object groups, and pasted into other ungrouped 
						  object groups.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">14. A new 'Undo All' edit menu command exists. This will undo all retained edit 
								operations including image imports, color changes, layering changes, page set 
						  changes and edit object changes.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">15. The Options dialog now includes a new Edit pane for edit subsystem options.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">16. A new Edit option can force the use of the Alt key for edit selection 
								operations. If this option is set edit selection boxes will not be seen if the 
						  mouse is dragged after missing a click on a KiSS object.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">17. A partial solution to the drawing problem for Text Editor line numbers has 
								been implemented. The screen is now repainted when the mouse button is released 
						  from the drag bar after the scroll.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">18. Kisekae UltraKiss now formats and writes the complete configuration file if 
								the active configuration is saved. The write references the memory state of the 
								active configuration and includes all FKiSS events and action commands. 
						  Original source comments are retained.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">19. New image import menu options exist to import image cels into a new object 
								group or into the existing selection set. Image cels imported into a new object 
								group ensures that a new object group and cel selection set is created for the 
								imported image cel. Image cels imported into the current selection set add the 
						  new image into the current ungrouped object.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">20. A new Edit option can be used to set the edit undo buffer limit. If the undo 
								limit is exceeded during normal operation the oldest undo records are silently 
						  removed.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">21. New Edit format options exist to control the FKiSS line output format when a 
								configuration file is saved. A standard text indent can be set for nested FKiSS 
								action statements within an FKiSS event. End of line comment statements can be 
						  placed at a preferred column.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">22. The hang problem experienced on page 6 of Balls.lzh has been resolved.</font></p>

					  <p><font face="Arial">9. There is a new File-Add command to load (expansion) data sets. This type of 
								load does not close the currently loaded set. Non-expansion sets can be added, 
								too. These sets will simply replace the currently loaded data set as was done 
						  before.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">10. The media options setting tab has been cosmetically restructured.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">11. Video cels now show a status message in the program status bar when they are

					  <p><font face="Arial">12. The order and names of some of the menu items has been changed for 
						  consistency of function.</font></p>
					  <p><font face="Arial">13. A maximum limit of 32 Java sound files, introduced through the Java Sound 
								migration, has been partially resolved. There is a limit of 32 files that can
